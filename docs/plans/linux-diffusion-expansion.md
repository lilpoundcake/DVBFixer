# Linux Diffusion Expansion Implementation Plan

- Status: proposed implementation plan rebased onto the 2026-10-06 expansion
  baseline; execute work packages only after explicit approval.
- Target branch: `feature/dvbfixer-hardening`.
- Scope owner: Structure Preparation bounded context.
- Exclusive coordinating change group: `missing-atom-rebuild-chirality`.
- Production baseline retained: MODELLER remains the default and supported
  backend until a separate evidence-backed production decision changes it.
- Related plans and decisions:
  - [`diffusion-gap-reconstruction.md`](diffusion-gap-reconstruction.md)
  - [`diffusion-cli-integration.md`](diffusion-cli-integration.md)
  - [`diffusion-runner-environments.md`](diffusion-runner-environments.md)
  - [`diffusion-heterogen-gap-reconstruction.md`](diffusion-heterogen-gap-reconstruction.md)
  - [`small-diffusion-apple-silicon-experiments.md`](small-diffusion-apple-silicon-experiments.md)
  - [`../adr/0011-experimental-diffusion-cli.md`](../adr/0011-experimental-diffusion-cli.md)

## Outcomes

- [ ] Complete checkpoint-backed Linux/NVIDIA acceptance for
  `protenix-v1-cuda` in a pinned environment.
- [ ] Complete class-aware protein geometry validation before widening the
  public scientific scope.
- [ ] Add reference-dependent benchmark metrics without combining unrelated
  score scales into one synthetic score.
- [ ] Replace the global 3-12 gap limit with profile-specific, evidence-backed
  capability strata.
- [ ] Complete causal acceptance and broader engine support for surrounding-aware
  gap reconstruction, building on the implemented Protpardelle local-partner
  conditioning slice.
- [ ] Add backend-aware batch output and diffusion-enabled `zbs`, and expand the
  implemented one-chain mosaic-first `homology` slice without changing MODELLER
  defaults.
- [ ] Preserve fail-closed admission, independent validation, atomic bundle
  publication, exact identities, and zero D-C-alpha output throughout.

## Current Expansion Baseline

- [x] Multichain input, multiple ordinary gaps, and independent per-gap-bearing-
  chain Protpardelle invocations are implemented.
- [x] Protpardelle receives deterministic contiguous crops from neighboring
  canonical protein chains when fixed heavy atoms are within `12 A` of a gap
  anchor. Partner atoms enter the real multichain motif axis and are recorded in
  sampler trace context mappings.
- [x] The current partner selection expands each contact crop by two sequence
  neighbors, retains contiguous observed runs, and obeys the 512-residue axis
  budget.
- [x] N-terminal and C-terminal one-anchor generation is implemented for the
  accepted Protpardelle profile, with broader frozen hardware cohorts pending.
- [x] An initial one-chain mosaic-first Homology insertion slice is implemented
  in CLI and GUI with authoritative coverage metadata and fixed covered atoms.
- [x] An isolated authoritative-SMILES fixed-ligand geometric-repulsion slice is
  implemented but remains separate from learned surrounding-protein context and
  from general heterogen support.
- [ ] Existing local-partner evidence is a checkpoint smoke, not the required
  frozen interface cohort or causal partner-on/off ablation.
- [ ] Multiple gap-bearing chains are not jointly sampled and the current crop
  does not adapt to the predicted gap trajectory.

## Non-Goals

- [ ] Do not remove the current gap-length limit before each replacement stratum
  passes preregistered acceptance gates.
- [ ] Do not call restored or re-spliced neighboring coordinates
  `surrounding-aware`; the engine must consume verified context features.
- [ ] Do not concatenate separate chains into a fake continuous protein to work
  around a model that lacks multichain conditioning.
- [ ] Do not silently downgrade context-conditioned requests to gap-only,
  preservation-only, another profile, or MODELLER.
- [ ] Do not infer ligand, glycan, PTM, cofactor, metal, or covalent-link
  chemistry in this protein-context expansion. The heterogen plan owns those
  classes.
- [ ] Do not add ML frameworks, engine packages, or checkpoints to the core
  wheel or `environment.yml`.
- [ ] Do not expose a new public scope before its fixtures, thresholds,
  comparison baseline, and failure policy are frozen.

## Why Gap Length Remains A Capability Stratum

- The current 3-12 range is an evidence boundary, not an architectural claim
  about the maximum sequence length accepted by Protenix.
- Longer gaps increase conformational uncertainty, candidate-count
  requirements, closure failures, context sensitivity, and ranking error.
- A long missing segment can transition from local repair into de novo or
  full-chain prediction; those tasks require different evidence and output
  claims.
- Replace one global constant with explicit profile capabilities only after the
  following strata are evaluated independently:
  - [ ] 3-12 residues: retain as the accepted baseline.
  - [ ] 13-25 residues: first expansion stratum.
  - [ ] 26-50 residues: separate high-cost research stratum.
  - [ ] More than 50 residues: require a separate architecture and product
    decision before implementation.
- Record candidate count, runtime, RAM, VRAM, closure rate, hard-gate pass rate,
  diversity, and ranking enrichment by gap-length stratum.

## Execution Rules For Subagents

- [ ] Assign one coordinating agent as the sole owner of shared contract,
  validation-policy, CLI-dispatch, and DDD-map changes.
- [ ] Give each implementation agent a disjoint work package and explicit file
  ownership; agents must not opportunistically edit another package's files.
- [ ] Require every agent handoff to report:
  - changed files;
  - contract or schema changes;
  - commands run and exact outcomes;
  - unresolved assumptions;
  - hardware, checkpoint, and environment identity when applicable;
  - whether generated documentation or fixture manifests need regeneration.
- [ ] Land shared contract changes before adapters and consumers branch from
  them; do not reconcile parallel incompatible schemas after implementation.
- [ ] Keep outcome-bearing benchmark execution separate from threshold design.
- [ ] Commit logical change groups independently so a failed scientific scope
  can be reverted without removing validated infrastructure.
- [ ] Do not commit checkpoints, credentials, private URLs, raw host
  environments, or ignored benchmark workspaces.

## Dependency Graph

- [ ] `WP0 -> WP1` establishes the reproducible Linux baseline.
- [ ] `WP2 -> WP3` establishes reusable measurements before hard-gate policy.
- [ ] `WP2 + WP3 -> WP4` enables broader scope evaluation.
- [ ] `WP5 -> WP6 -> WP7` establishes context contracts, selectors, and engine
  adapters before context-conditioned claims.
- [ ] `WP3 + WP4 + WP7 -> WP8` enables surrounding-aware acceptance studies.
- [ ] `WP1 + WP3 -> WP9` enables backend-neutral orchestration hardening.
- [ ] `WP9 -> WP10 -> WP11` enables batch and ZBS integration.
- [ ] `WP5 + WP7 + WP9 -> WP12` enables mosaic-first Homology.
- [ ] `WP13` performs final repository and hardware verification after all
  approved packages complete.

## WP0: Baseline And Host Inventory

- Suggested owner: integration coordinator.
- Owned surfaces:
  - branch state and release metadata;
  - generated-reference status;
  - hardware/environment evidence under `docs/research/`.
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Start from the current remote `feature/dvbfixer-hardening` tip without
    including unrelated local or untracked files.
  - [ ] Record GPU model, compute capability, VRAM, driver, CUDA runtime, CPU,
    RAM, local storage, and available OCI runtime.
  - [ ] Record the operator-provided checkpoint path only where operationally
    required and store only its SHA-256 in tracked evidence.
  - [ ] Run the current CPU diffusion suite and preserve its exact result.
  - [ ] Run CLI-reference, GUI-spec, DDD-map, version, lint, and type checks;
    resolve pre-existing generated-reference drift as a separate change group.
  - [ ] Freeze the current profile metadata, protocol version, validation
    thresholds, and 231-case confirmatory aggregate before modifications.
- Exit gate:
  - [ ] The baseline is reproducible and any pre-existing failures are separated
    from failures introduced by later packages.

## WP1: Linux/NVIDIA Protenix Acceptance

- Suggested owner: platform runner agent with access to the NVIDIA host.
- Owned surfaces:
  - `deploy/protenix-v1/`;
  - Linux runner environment and image definitions;
  - profile-specific acceptance scripts and evidence.
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Pin Python, PyTorch, CUDA runtime, Protenix source revision, callback
    patch digest, OpenMM stack, auxiliary artifacts, and package lock.
  - [ ] Pin the base image by digest and record the final image digest when an
    OCI runtime is available.
  - [ ] Verify checkpoint SHA-256 before model loading; do not download or
    redistribute the checkpoint from core DVBFixer.
  - [ ] Assert CUDA availability, expected device class, model/input/output
    placement, dtype, callback count, and disabled fallback.
  - [ ] Bound timeout, process groups, stdout, stderr, artifact sizes, workspace
    use, RAM, and VRAM; clean all private workspaces after failure.
  - [ ] Run protocol preflight, one checkpoint-backed reconstruction, same-seed
    independent repeats, different-seed candidates, and failure injection.
  - [ ] Repeat the frozen 231-case cohort and compare hard-gate pass rate,
    selected geometry, fixed-coordinate adherence, runtime, RAM, VRAM, crash,
    timeout, and OOM rates with the accepted confirmatory baseline.
  - [ ] Add a manual or self-hosted NVIDIA acceptance lane while keeping core CI
    CUDA-independent.
- Stop gates:
  - [ ] Stop on silent CPU fallback, wrong-device tensors, source/patch/checkpoint
    mismatch, incomplete callback evidence, fixed-coordinate drift, or partial
    publication.
  - [ ] Do not widen public scope until the production wrapper reproduces the
    accepted baseline.

## WP2: Pure Geometry Measurement Layer

- Suggested owner: geometry agent.
- Owned surfaces:
  - `src/dvbfixer/diagnose/geometry.py`;
  - new pure measurement modules approved by the coordinator;
  - focused geometry tests.
- Tasks:
  - [x] Keep measurements free of severity and diffusion-specific pass/fail
    policy.
  - [x] Preserve full case-sensitive residue and atom identities, including
    insertion codes.
  - [x] Add class-aware Ramachandran measurements for general, GLY, PRO, and
    pre-PRO residues.
  - [x] Add residue-aware chi1-only, chi1/chi2, chi3-chi5, and
    backbone-dependent rotamer measurements where reference data support them.
  - [x] Add residue-specific bond-length, bond-angle, peptide-planarity,
    cis/trans, junction, and terminal measurements.
  - [x] Add expected intra-residue, peptide, and disulfide connectivity evidence
    without inferring unsupported chemistry.
  - [x] Provide deterministic heavy-atom and hydrogen-aware steric measurements
    for generated/generated, generated/fixed, and junction neighborhoods.
  - [x] Return explicit undefined results for missing, duplicate, degenerate, or
    unsupported geometry rather than a passing value.
- Exit gate:
  - [x] Existing unscoped `diagnose` behavior remains compatible unless a
    separately approved diagnostic policy change is documented and tested.

## WP3: Diffusion Validation Policy

- Suggested owner: exclusive validation-policy coordinator.
- Owned surfaces:
  - `src/dvbfixer/model/diffusion/validate.py`;
  - `src/dvbfixer/model/diffusion/quality.py`;
  - versioned validation manifests and focused tests.
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Map approved WP2 measurements to versioned diffusion hard gates.
  - [ ] Add GLY/PRO/pre-PRO Ramachandran policy.
  - [ ] Add chi1-only, chi3-chi5, and full residue/backbone-dependent rotamer
    policy where calibrated reference data exist.
  - [ ] Validate canonical atom completeness, duplicate atoms, identity,
    connectivity, peptide links, disulfides, planarity, clashes, and final
    chirality after the last heavy-coordinate change.
  - [ ] Preserve fixed-heavy RMSD at no more than `0.01 A` and maximum
    displacement at no more than `0.03 A` unless a separately versioned study
    changes those limits before outcomes are viewed.
  - [ ] Record every skipped or undefined metric with a stable reason; never
    interpret missing evidence as passing.
- Exit gate:
  - [ ] Every published candidate passes the same independent validator
    regardless of engine-native confidence or score.

## WP4: Reference-Dependent Benchmark Metrics

- Suggested owner: benchmark agent.
- Owned surfaces:
  - `src/dvbfixer/model/diffusion/benchmark.py`;
  - benchmark schemas, aggregation scripts, and tests.
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Add generated-region and junction-neighborhood lDDT.
  - [ ] Add interface lDDT and contact precision/recall for declared interface
    cases.
  - [ ] Add GDT-HA only where the evaluated region is large enough for the
    metric to be interpretable.
  - [ ] Add TM-score only for declared full-domain or sufficiently long-region
    comparisons; do not report it for short loops.
  - [ ] Preserve gap backbone/all-heavy RMSD, fixed/anchor RMSD, top-1, oracle
    top-k, pairwise diversity, ranking enrichment, and failure classes.
  - [ ] Report paired MODELLER comparisons and confidence intervals by stratum.
  - [ ] Keep engine confidence, MODELLER `molpdf`, physical energies,
    independent geometry, and reference metrics as separate named scales.
- Exit gate:
  - [ ] No aggregate score hides a hard-gate failure or compares unlike
    objectives as if they shared a physical scale.

## WP5: Backend-Neutral Context Contract Expansion

- Suggested owner: contract coordinator; this package lands before any adapter.
- Owned surfaces:
  - `src/dvbfixer/model/diffusion/contract.py`;
  - protocol serialization and compatibility tests;
  - provenance and sampler-trace schemas.
- Existing baseline:
  - [x] Schema version 4 records exact partner-chain/atom conditioning contexts
    and verifies represented fixed atoms in sampler traces.
  - [x] Existing provenance distinguishes local protein-partner context and
    fixed heterogen context.
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Extend the protocol to represent four disjoint atom roles consistently
    across protein, mosaic, and future supported chemistry context:
    - `generated`;
    - `movable-junction`;
    - `fixed-conditioning`;
    - `preserved-only`.
  - [ ] Represent context residues and atoms with exact chain, residue number,
    insertion code, atom name, coordinates, and source identity.
  - [ ] Record context-selection policy, shell thresholds, complete selected
    identity digest, represented-context digest, and engine mapping digest.
  - [ ] Require the runner result and sampler trace to state which context atoms
    reached the model, which were projected after each update, and which were
    only restored after sampling.
  - [ ] Add stable capability labels:
    - `gap-only`;
    - `same-chain-conditioned`;
    - `multichain-conditioned`;
    - `preservation-only`.
  - [ ] Reject old protocol versions when they cannot prove context semantics;
    do not infer capability from absent fields.
- Exit gate:
  - [ ] A result cannot claim surrounding-aware behavior unless the trace proves
    that the declared fixed context was represented and consumed by the sampler.

## WP6: Deterministic Context Selection Expansion

- Suggested owner: context-selection agent.
- Owned surfaces:
  - a new backend-neutral context-selection module under
    `src/dvbfixer/model/diffusion/`;
  - scope/admission integration and focused tests.
- Existing baseline:
  - [x] Protpardelle selects contiguous partner-chain crops within `12 A` of the
    original anchors, expands by two sequence neighbors, and enforces a shared
    512-residue axis budget.
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Always include both anchors and complete selected residues.
  - [ ] Compare the current selector with configurable same-chain sequence
    flanks, initially evaluated at 8 and 16 residues on each side.
  - [ ] Compare the current `12 A` anchor selector with complete-residue spatial
    shells preregistered before outcome-bearing runs:
    - direct context: at most `6 A` from a generated or junction atom;
    - secondary context: greater than `6 A` and at most `10 A`;
    - distant context: ablation-only negative control.
  - [x] Expand selected Protpardelle contacts into contiguous chain fragments
    and record the expansion.
  - [ ] Generalize the expansion policy into a backend-neutral selector rather
    than duplicating it in each engine adapter.
  - [ ] Enforce a deterministic context budget with priority order: anchors,
    direct contacts, interface residues, secondary shell, then sequence flanks.
  - [ ] Preserve case-distinct chains and insertion codes; never select through
    concatenated display strings or numeric residue ranges alone.
  - [ ] Return a stable unsupported reason when required context exceeds engine
    capability or budget; never silently drop neighboring chains.
- Exit gate:
  - [ ] Identical normalized input and policy produce byte-identical context
    identities, ordering, and digests.

## WP7: Engine Context Adapters

### WP7A: Protenix

- Suggested owner: Protenix adapter agent.
- Owned surfaces:
  - `deploy/protenix-v1/`;
  - profile adapter and trace tests.
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Audit the pinned engine's multichain and template representation rather
    than relying on upstream marketing or schema acceptance.
  - [ ] Map selected neighboring protein fragments onto a stable engine atom
    axis and prove a round trip to exact DVBFixer identities.
  - [ ] Pass neighboring chains as fixed conditioning entities.
  - [ ] Reinject every represented fixed coordinate after every denoising update.
  - [ ] Fail on feature loss, atom reordering without a verified map, chain
    collapse, callback mismatch, or context drift.
  - [ ] Keep refinement movement limited to generated and explicitly movable
    junction atoms.

### WP7B: Protpardelle Capability Audit

- Suggested owner: compact-model agent, isolated from the Protenix adapter.
- Owned surfaces:
  - `deploy/protpardelle-1c/` research/audit scripts;
  - compact-model evidence documents.
- Existing baseline:
  - [x] The pinned model accepts neighboring canonical protein crops as separate
    chains on the real multichain motif axis.
  - [x] Exact target-to-partner chain and atom mappings are recorded and checked
    against represented fixed sampler atoms.
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Prove causal denoiser use with controlled partner-on/off and perturbed-
    context ablations; motif-axis representation alone is insufficient for the
    final scientific claim.
  - [ ] Quantify which discontinuous same-chain, multiple-chain, chain-identity,
    and fixed-coordinate features affect generated coordinates.
  - [ ] Retain `local-partner-conditioned` rather than whole-complex terminology
    until joint-sampling and frozen interface gates pass.
  - [ ] Do not concatenate neighboring chains with the target sequence.

### WP7C: Purpose-Trained Compact Context Model, If Required

- Suggested owner: model-research agent; begins only after WP7B records a
  blocker and a separate implementation approval is granted.
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Design an invariant or equivariant fixed-context encoder.
  - [ ] Preserve chain-aware and insertion-code-aware residue embeddings.
  - [ ] Add cross-attention or an equivalent explicit interaction between the
    generated gap and fixed environment.
  - [ ] Initialize or diffuse generated atoms only and project fixed represented
    coordinates after every update.
  - [ ] Train with same-chain, interface, context-dropout, and negative-control
    masks using leakage-controlled structure splits.
  - [ ] Freeze dataset, split, source, configuration, and checkpoint provenance
    before confirmatory evaluation.
  - [ ] Keep weights and runtime dependencies outside core DVBFixer.

## WP8: Surrounding-Aware Ablation And Acceptance

- Suggested owner: scientific evaluation agent who did not implement the engine
  adapter being evaluated.
- Owned surfaces:
  - frozen manifests and result aggregation under `docs/research/`;
  - no production policy code.
- Required ablation arms, using identical structures, masks, and seeds:
  - [ ] anchors and gap only;
  - [ ] same-chain sequence flanks;
  - [ ] same-chain spatial environment;
  - [ ] same-chain plus neighboring-chain fragments;
  - [ ] full supported protein environment;
  - [ ] context plus per-step fixed-coordinate projection;
  - [ ] context, projection, and localized boundary refinement.
- Required strata:
  - [ ] solvent-exposed loops without interchain contacts;
  - [ ] buried and protein-core loops;
  - [ ] chain-interface gaps;
  - [ ] antibody CDRs near the H/L interface;
  - [ ] oligomeric interfaces;
  - [ ] neighboring-chain contacts within 3-6 A;
  - [ ] distant neighboring chains as negative controls;
  - [ ] insertion-code and case-distinct-chain cases.
- Required context metrics:
  - [ ] interface lDDT;
  - [ ] contact precision and recall;
  - [ ] minimum interchain distance and severe interchain clashes;
  - [ ] gap orientation relative to neighboring chains;
  - [ ] gap RMSD after alignment on fixed environment only;
  - [ ] change from gap-only to context-conditioned inference;
  - [ ] sensitivity to shell size and context budget;
  - [ ] fixed-context RMSD and maximum displacement;
  - [ ] ranking enrichment with and without context.
- Hard gates:
  - [ ] The trace proves that claimed context reached the sampler.
  - [ ] All fixed represented context passes existing coordinate thresholds.
  - [ ] No chain or insertion-code identity is lost.
  - [ ] No false interchain bond is introduced.
  - [ ] Context does not create a severe interface clash.
  - [ ] Unsupported context fails before inference without automatic fallback.

## WP9: Backend-Neutral Model Orchestration

- Suggested owner: integration coordinator.
- Owned surfaces:
  - shared model orchestration and backend dispatch;
  - command metadata and output contracts.
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Introduce backend-neutral model request, options, candidate, outcome, and
    artifact-set types.
  - [ ] Keep CIF normalization, sequence placement, chain discovery, CONECT/link
    handling, and output naming in common preprocessing.
  - [ ] Keep MODELLER behavior and file output unchanged.
  - [ ] Keep diffusion directory bundles and validation/provenance semantics
    explicit rather than hiding them behind file-only assumptions.
  - [ ] Expose backend capability metadata for gap length, terminal gaps,
    multiple gaps, multichain context, batch, ZBS, and Homology.
  - [ ] Reject unsupported option combinations before preprocessing or runner
    launch.

## WP10: Batch Diffusion

- Suggested owner: batch agent.
- Owned surfaces:
  - `src/dvbfixer/batch.py`;
  - command registry metadata;
  - batch-specific tests.
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Make output mode and suffix backend-dependent.
  - [ ] Publish each diffusion result as `<stem>_model_diffusion/`.
  - [ ] Preflight every destination and collision before the first runner launch.
  - [ ] Isolate workspaces and cleanup per input.
  - [ ] Add bounded GPU concurrency, defaulting to one inference job per GPU.
  - [ ] Define explicit seed lists or deterministic per-input seed derivation and
    record it in provenance.
  - [ ] Produce a bounded aggregate report with success, unsupported, failed,
    and skipped outcomes.
  - [ ] Preserve no-partial-bundle and source/output containment guarantees.

## WP11: ZBS Diffusion Integration

- Suggested owner: ZBS workflow agent.
- Owned surfaces:
  - `src/dvbfixer/zbs.py` and ZBS-specific tests/docs.
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Add explicit `--model-backend {modeller,diffusion}` and compatible
    diffusion options without changing the default.
  - [ ] Prohibit automatic fallback to MODELLER or another diffusion profile.
  - [ ] Treat the validated selected candidate inside the diffusion bundle as the
    input to `prepare` while preserving the complete bundle as provenance.
  - [ ] Merge `.dat` only through `DatRecord`.
  - [ ] Keep all intermediates beside the final output under batch operation.
  - [ ] Preserve final numbering and postflight diagnose order.
  - [ ] Define restart behavior that never trusts an incomplete or unvalidated
    existing bundle.
  - [ ] Use `--no-solvent` for development and acceptance iterations unless a
    separately requested solvent evaluation is running.

## WP12: Mosaic-First Homology Diffusion

- Suggested owner: Homology agent; coordinate shared contract changes through
  the integration coordinator.
- Owned surfaces:
  - `src/dvbfixer/homology_plan.py`;
  - Homology backend orchestration;
  - Homology fixtures and focused tests.
- Existing baseline:
  - [x] `homology --backend diffusion` and the GUI Model workflow use
    `selected_template_mosaic.pdb` as the authoritative frame.
  - [x] Companion coverage records zero-based half-open masks, precedence,
    template ownership, and fixed covered atoms in provenance.
  - [x] A one-chain five-residue internal insertion passed a checkpoint-backed
    MPS smoke without fixed-coordinate drift.
- Contract tasks:
  - [x] Keep `selected_template_mosaic.pdb` as the single authoritative
    coordinate frame.
  - [x] Export versioned coverage metadata from `materialize_template_plan`:
    target chain, template ownership, zero-based half-open spans, fixed/movable/
    generated masks, source provenance, and frame transforms.
  - [x] Never reconstruct template ownership later from the serialized PDB.
  - [ ] Feed supported neighboring template chains through the expanded WP5
    fixed-conditioning contract and prove causal context use.
- Initial slice:
  - [x] Support one target chain and one internal uncovered insertion.
  - [x] Generate uncovered insertion and terminal residues while covered
    sequence mismatches remain fail closed.
  - [x] Keep every covered template atom fixed and validate mosaic adherence.
  - [ ] Compare diffusion and MODELLER from the identical target and template
    plan.
- Expansion sequence:
  - [ ] Generate template-covered substitutions through explicit bounded
    junction windows.
  - [ ] Multiple uncovered spans.
  - [ ] Substitutions and deletions.
  - [ ] Multiple templates already fitted into the shared reference frame.
  - [ ] Multichain targets and interfaces.
  - [ ] Antibody H/L targets with distinct PDB chains, insertion codes, and
    shared interface context; never collapse both logical chains to `V`.
- Promotion gate:
  - [ ] Do not expose public Homology diffusion until mosaic adherence,
    multichain identity, interface context, geometry, ranking, and atomic
    publication gates pass.

## WP13: Final Verification And Decision Records

- Suggested owner: integration coordinator with independent scientific review.
- Tasks:
  - [ ] Run focused tests for every completed package.
  - [ ] Run the full CPU diffusion contract, scope, runner, validation,
    publication, provenance, benchmark, batch, ZBS, and Homology suites.
  - [ ] Run `pytest -m 'not slow' -q`.
  - [ ] Run `ruff check src/dvbfixer`.
  - [ ] Run strict mypy targets plus new typed diffusion entry points.
  - [ ] Run `python scripts/check_agent_docs.py`.
  - [ ] Run `python scripts/gen_cli_reference.py --check`.
  - [ ] Run `python scripts/gen_gui_spec.py --check`.
  - [ ] Run GUI typecheck/tests if registry or generated schema changes.
  - [ ] Repeat checkpoint-backed NVIDIA smoke and every approved outcome-bearing
    cohort in the pinned environment.
  - [ ] Record separate decisions for Linux profile acceptance, each scientific
    stratum, surrounding-aware capability, batch, ZBS, Homology, and any future
    production promotion.

## Global Stop/Go Gates

- **STOP:** thresholds, context shells, candidate counts, or comparison rules
  change after outcome-bearing results are inspected without a versioned new
  study.
- **STOP:** an adapter claims context conditioning without trace evidence that
  the model consumed the declared context.
- **STOP:** any fixed atom, chain identity, insertion code, explicit supported
  link, or authoritative mosaic span is silently changed or dropped.
- **STOP:** a runner falls back across device, engine, profile, context mode, or
  MODELLER without an explicit new invocation.
- **STOP:** an unsupported input launches inference or leaves partial public
  output.
- **STOP:** expanding gap length materially lowers preregistered hard-gate pass
  rate or ranking performance without an explicit unsupported boundary.
- **GO:** accept only the exact engine, environment, scope stratum, context
  capability, and workflow that passed its frozen gates.
- **GO does not mean:** diffusion becomes default, MODELLER is deprecated,
  arbitrary chemistry is supported, checkpoints may be redistributed, or an
  unevaluated profile inherits another profile's evidence.
