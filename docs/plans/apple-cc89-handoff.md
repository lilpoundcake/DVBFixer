# Apple Silicon handoff: corrected cc89 local input

Historical cc89 replay document. New Protpardelle production installations use
[cc94](../../deploy/protpardelle-1c/cc94.md), with native relative encoding and ODE
sampling; the cc89 rotary intervention and acceptance evidence below do not apply
to cc94. Native cc94 MPS acceptance remains pending.

Originally prepared on Linux after public CUDA baseline **`cb43db6`**, branch
`feature/dvbfixer-hardening`. Subsequent native Apple implementation and evidence
are recorded below. The historical public MPS profile retains its native-phase/
native-position implementation alongside the new versioned corrected profile.

The adapter now implements the opt-in
`protpardelle-1c-mps-source-physical-research-v1` mode. This is **not** a public
profile promotion by itself. The [corrected Apple pilot](../research/cc89-apple-corrected-pilot.md)
now passes independent geometry/source checks **8/8 after CPU refinement** (raw
5/8), with research-runner resume verified. A larger operational cohort remains
deferred; synthetic/one-step checks alone are
not reconstruction acceptance. Subsequent
[public Apple integration](../research/cc89-public-apple-acceptance.md) now passes
5/5 candidates across four workflows with versioned
`protpardelle-1c-mps-local-v1`, while retaining the historical public profile.

## Resume here

Read `AGENTS.md`, this file, then:

1. [Public CUDA acceptance](../research/cc89-public-cuda-acceptance.md).
2. [Input/position root cause](../research/cc89-input-representation-audit.md).
3. [Apple deployment and pinned identities](../../deploy/protpardelle-1c/README.md#apple-silicon-preparation).

Current evidence: corrected development recheck **60/60**, source-disjoint
follow-up **24/24 on four sources**, and public CUDA integration **5/5 across four
model/Homology workflows**, including multi-seed publication and resume. Apple
adds the separate 8/8 research portability check and 5/5 public integration above.
These are overlapping studies, not independent structures summed across runs. Geometry/source
preservation is primary; reference RMSD is secondary, never a seed selector.

Public CUDA scope: one CYS-free internal 5–10-residue gap, at most 512 whole-source
canonical protein residues, fixed source-only local context, neutral extra chain
phase, physical source sequence positions, and generated-only CUDA refinement.
MODELLER remains default. Old negative full-context results remain archived.

## What travels in Git

- The source code, profile/environment definitions, frozen protocols, and reports.
- `tests/fixtures/cc89_apple_handoff/`: three whole observed protein source PDBs,
  companion unchanged FASTAs, original four mask specifications, and SHA-256
  bindings to the audited Linux cohorts. These contain **experimental input
  coordinates**, not generated candidates. They are sufficient for the first
  four-case/eight-seed corrected-MPS pilot on a fresh clone.
- `scripts/prepare_apple_cc89_handoff.py`: reconstructs exact source-minus-gap
  inputs, masked templates, explicit local research requests and position digests
  without neural inference. Evaluation references go in a separate directory.

No `.artifacts/`, historical `test/`, visual-review folders, environments,
checkpoints or credentials are required from this Linux workspace. The checkpoint
and matching cc89 config must be supplied separately by the operator. Do not
commit or redistribute them. The three source structures may overlap pretraining;
the pilot is a portability check, not a new independent holdout.

## First commands on the Mac

Use a fresh native macOS arm64 checkout (not Rosetta), then work from its root:

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch feature/dvbfixer-hardening
git pull --ff-only origin feature/dvbfixer-hardening
git status --short
shasum -a 256 -c tests/fixtures/MANIFEST.sha256

export DVBFIXER_ROOT="$PWD"
export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1
export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=0
unset PYTORCH_MPS_FAST_MATH PYTORCH_MPS_PREFER_METAL
unset PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO PYTORCH_MPS_LOW_WATERMARK_RATIO
```

Provision core DVBFixer and native Apple sampling using
[`docs/installation.md`](../installation.md) and the existing
[`environment-apple-arm64.yml`](../../deploy/protpardelle-1c/environment-apple-arm64.yml).
Keep core's Python `>=3.11,<3.14` and NumPy `<2.5`. Keep the sampling Python 3.12
and Torch 2.6.0 pinned. Do not install the Linux CUDA environments on macOS.
Use a separate clean upstream checkout at
`ee378400f25b801fa481028000f9060183d7fb4c` with **only**
`apple-portability.patch`; do not combine it with `per-step-callback.patch`.
The deployment guide supplies the exact checkpoint/config/patch hashes.

Set `PROTPARDELLE_ROOT` to that clean Apple checkout, `CHECKPOINT` to the
operator-provided `model_params/weights/cc89_epoch415.pth`, and `CONFIG` to its
matching `model_params/configs/cc89.yaml`. Verify both before any neural call:

```bash
shasum -a 256 "$CHECKPOINT" "$CONFIG"
# checkpoint: dfc9895b399ec4497bf6d646502168725f01dcbd55bc0b541fc3e3cc1f2f0483
# config:     e9999ace79bf3044351cc982a624fc3459add3a4f91cbf97ff5b437b8942eb9d
```

Export the Apple environment lock, then run the existing inventory collector
from that environment; its lock path must exist and the checkout must be clean:

```bash
mkdir -p .artifacts/apple-cc89
micromamba env export -n dvbfixer-protpardelle-apple --explicit \
  > .artifacts/apple-cc89/environment-explicit.txt
micromamba run -n dvbfixer-protpardelle-apple python \
  scripts/collect_apple_diffusion_inventory.py \
  .artifacts/apple-cc89/host-inventory.json \
  --environment-lock .artifacts/apple-cc89/environment-explicit.txt

# Run this materialization in core, not in an incompletely provisioned ML env.
PYTHONPATH="$DVBFIXER_ROOT/src" micromamba run -n dvbfixer python \
  scripts/prepare_apple_cc89_handoff.py --output .artifacts/apple-cc89/controls-v1
```

`inputs.json` records **four cases, eight requests, inference_executed=false**.
Use each case's root `request-seed7.json` / `request-seed19.json` as the corrected
research request. The older files under `requests/` are materialization provenance,
not the corrected request entry points. Never copy `evaluation/` or the tracked
native source PDBs into a sampling/refinement workspace.

## Implemented Apple research mode

`checkpoint_gap_smoke.py` requires both `--corrected-mps-research` and the explicit
research profile in the request, with matched `neutral-v1` / `source-physical-v1`
policies and the fixed source-only local context. Native arm64 Python 3.12,
Torch 2.6.0, pinned upstream revision/Apple patch, checkpoint/config identities,
MPS availability and disabled fallback are checked before sampling.

The adapter preserves physical chain breaks and records the actual research
identity in trace/provenance. Passive instrumentation checks
`net.transformer.layers[0][0].rope`, not the unused template `transformer.rope`.
Upstream calls RoPE's `forward` directly, so the instrumentation wraps that method
temporarily rather than relying on an inactive PyTorch module hook. It records
actual consumed positions, neutral phase, device and query/key call counts.
No per-step reinjection is added.

[`scripts/run_apple_cc89_pilot.py`](../../scripts/run_apple_cc89_pilot.py) freezes
the eight original requests, source/code/runtime hashes, environment exports,
smoke identities, numerical settings and timeouts before execution. Workers get
only their request and gapped source. Sampling runs sequentially on MPS;
generated-only `refine_runner_result(..., platform_name="CPU")` runs in the core
environment. Interpreter paths are kept without resolving venv symlinks.
Resume verifies archive hashes and never repeats terminal failures or interrupted
outcomes. The audit checks geometry, outside-gap records, actual RoPE evidence,
source-position provenance and the generated-atom `DatRecord` handoff, without
reading an evaluation reference or selecting by RMSD.

Use the synthetic smoke commands in the deployment guide, writing their outputs
as `cpu-operator-smoke.json`, `mps-operator-smoke.json` and
`operator-comparison.json` under `.artifacts/apple-cc89/`. Then:

```bash
# Preserve the native environment paths, not their resolved symlink targets.
SAMPLING_PYTHON="$(micromamba run -n dvbfixer-protpardelle-apple python -B -c 'import sys; print(sys.executable)')"
REFINEMENT_PYTHON="$(micromamba run -n dvbfixer python -B -c 'import sys; print(sys.executable)')"

"$REFINEMENT_PYTHON" scripts/run_apple_cc89_pilot.py freeze \
  --controls .artifacts/apple-cc89/controls-v1 \
  --inventory .artifacts/apple-cc89/host-inventory.json \
  --operator-comparison .artifacts/apple-cc89/operator-comparison.json \
  --sampling-python "$SAMPLING_PYTHON" --refinement-python "$REFINEMENT_PYTHON" \
  --engine-root "$PROTPARDELLE_ROOT" --checkpoint "$CHECKPOINT" --config "$CONFIG" \
  --protocol .artifacts/apple-cc89/execution-v1.json
"$REFINEMENT_PYTHON" scripts/run_apple_cc89_pilot.py run \
  --protocol .artifacts/apple-cc89/execution-v1.json \
  --output .artifacts/apple-cc89/probes-v1 --stage probe
"$REFINEMENT_PYTHON" scripts/run_apple_cc89_pilot.py run \
  --protocol .artifacts/apple-cc89/execution-v1.json \
  --output .artifacts/apple-cc89/pilot-v1 --probes .artifacts/apple-cc89/probes-v1 \
  --stage pilot
"$REFINEMENT_PYTHON" scripts/run_apple_cc89_pilot.py audit \
  --protocol .artifacts/apple-cc89/execution-v1.json \
  --output .artifacts/apple-cc89/pilot-v1 --report .artifacts/apple-cc89/results-v1.json
```

All destinations must be new. Freeze only after code changes are complete:
execution refuses changed source hashes. If the development checkout contains
unrelated untracked files, use the inventory collector's `--repository` option
with a separate clean baseline worktree; disclose that scope. The protocol binds
the actual development files independently. Never remove user files to satisfy
the clean-checkout gate.

### Versioned public integration and remaining rollout

The passed pilot was followed by coordinated profile metadata/admission,
installer/default context routing, trace contract and GUI semantics for the new
`protpardelle-1c-mps-local-v1` identity. The old `protpardelle-1c-mps` identity remains
available for explicit legacy replay. Public model/Homology, multi-seed publication
and resume checks pass; see the [retained failures and final integration evidence](../research/cc89-public-apple-acceptance.md).
Wider operational/memory/latency acceptance remains pending.
CUDA-only `prepare_cuda_cc89_request` must not be reused by simply changing its
profile string. Preserve atomic publication and exact frozen-request replay.

## Execution order and acceptance

1. Existing synthetic CPU/MPS operator smokes and comparison, as documented in
   the deployment guide. Record real MPS availability, all tensor devices and
   synchronized timings; no fallback.
2. Corrected source-position probe and one-step device test after research-mode
   implementation. This is an operator check, not a successful reconstruction.
3. Four portable masks × original seeds 7/19, 500 steps, scale 1.2, churn 200,
   native conditioning; run sequentially and archive every outcome. Freeze the
   new execution protocol before the first corrected MPS sample.
4. Unchanged generated-only CPU refinement and independent geometry, junction,
   clashes, D-Cα, exact outside-gap records, `.dat`, trace and request checks.
   Do not choose seeds by reference RMSD; do not replace terminal failures.
5. Public model/Homology, multi-seed and resume checks on native filesystem;
   then a larger memory/latency/operational cohort before wider acceptance.

The CUDA public controls used seeds 7 for 9WW8-gap5, 8EK6-H-CDR1 and
9Z0U-H-CDR3, and seeds 7/19 for 9WW8-gap10. All eight original corrected research
outcomes remain available in the tracked prospective result reports. MPS outputs
need not be byte-identical to CUDA or CPU refinement outputs.

On Linux, the handoff materializer and coordinate-withholding regression are
tested without a checkpoint. Linux fast-suite baseline at `cb43db6` is **1,175
passed, 7 skipped**; GUI **244 passed**. Full-following mypy has 35 pre-existing
errors reproduced on `5a402cc`; the explicit API/context targets pass with
`--follow-imports=silent`. Do not spend the portability session fixing unrelated
typing errors or declaring MPS acceptance from these Linux tests.

## Suggested first instruction to the next agent

> Read AGENTS.md and docs/plans/apple-cc89-handoff.md. Continue the corrected
> cc89 local-input Apple port from the pushed branch. Verify native arm64/MPS,
> Review the completed 8/8 research pilot and 5/5 versioned public integration,
> including the retained failed development protocol and exact frozen-request
> replay check. The next step is a separately frozen larger operational cohort,
> not a silent scope expansion. Keep legacy replay intact. Geometry and
> preservation are primary; no hidden reference coordinates, no seed selection
> by RMSD, no denoising fallback.
