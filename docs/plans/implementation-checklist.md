# Implementation Checklist

This is the canonical completion tracker for the plans in this directory.
Current cross-plan navigation is in [Plan status and remaining work](README.md).
Status synchronized on 2026-10-20: software delivery, per-profile hardware
acceptance and wider scientific/default promotion are separate completion gates.
Check an item only after its implementation and required verification are
complete. Detailed requirements remain in these authoritative sources:

- [API roadmap](api-roadmap.md) for API implementation and deployment.
- [DDD documentation roadmap](ddd-documentation-roadmap.md) for agent maps and domain documentation.
- [Diffusion gap-reconstruction plan](diffusion-gap-reconstruction.md) for the proposed experimental modeling backend.
- [Small diffusion and Apple Silicon plan](small-diffusion-apple-silicon-experiments.md) for compact local-model research.
- [Diffusion with heterogen context plan](diffusion-heterogen-gap-reconstruction.md) for class-specific research on retaining and conditioning on small molecules, cofactors, ions/metals, glycans, PTMs, and covalent ligands during protein-gap reconstruction.
- [Diffusion runner environment plan](diffusion-runner-environments.md) for separate core, Apple MPS, and Linux/NVIDIA dependency boundaries and production protocol wrappers.
- [Continuation context](api-ddd-continuation-context.md) for historical evidence only.
- [Approved installation-profile handoff](installation-profiles-handoff.md) for Standard/Desktop, the conda-family helper and clean-install acceptance.

Status is binary: `[x]` means complete and verified; `[ ]` means remaining,
partially complete, optional but not accepted, or not yet verified.

## Installation profiles: Standard/Desktop

Added 2026-10-28. Requirements and next-session starting point:
[implementation handoff](installation-profiles-handoff.md).

- [x] Record user approval and the correction that PySCF/RESP and MDAnalysis/Plotly remain in Standard/Desktop; Desktop inherits the scientific composition.
- [x] Merge Probe/xTB work into main at `cc0716c`, verify the merged baseline, and create `feature/installation-profiles`. This is baseline verification, not installer acceptance.
- [x] Define the dependency/feature matrix, one composition source and profile/readiness contracts (WP1).
- [x] Align Standard/Desktop/add-on specifications and Python metadata, including a verified single Open Babel provider (WP2).
- [ ] Implement interactive/noninteractive helper and micromamba/mamba/conda adapters without modifying existing environments implicitly (WP3).
- [ ] Implement protected MODELLER setup, Desktop build and separate diffusion-runtime preparation/registration (WP3).
- [ ] Add profile-aware doctor/preflight for scientific commands, ANARCI/HMMER/data, MSA, analysis and included PySCF RESP (WP4).
- [ ] Verify clean Standard/Desktop installs and add-ons with real functional smokes for each claimed manager/platform; retain not-tested states (WP5).
- [ ] Synchronize manual installation, documentation, CI and agent status, then finish the proven GUI/MSA migration without removing Standard scientific capabilities (WP6).

Implementation is underway. WP1/WP2 are verified; subsequent work and actual clean-install
evidence are tracked in [profile acceptance](../installation-profile-acceptance.md).
xTB remains removed under ADR 0012; Probe stays optional. Old core/full/extras
proposals are not the approved installation interface.

## Geometry-gated anchor relaxation

Added 2026-10-27. Detailed execution requirements and evidence boundaries:
[headless handoff](geometry-gated-anchor-relaxation-handoff.md).

- [x] Record the 9CQD uniform/B-weighted positional-restraint pilot and visual-review exports.
- [x] Record user-approved geometry-triggered stages, raw-input restart, default-enabled anchor repair and explicit notifications.
- [x] Add initial pure B-weighting/fallback, explicit movement-bound measurement, staged-controller and scientific anchor-force helpers with narrow regression tests.
- [x] Add an independent research audit with explicit per-anchor limits, raw-input bindings, old strict-result preservation, outer-junction and observed-record checks; verify no-op native 1UBQ controls.
- [x] Replay all eight corrected-cc89 pilot cases with metadata/B provenance checks and shared-minimization accounting: five raw no-ops, three generated-only repairs, no observed-anchor motion.
- [x] Add bounded typed numerical-failure recovery and independent raw-based failure auditing; reject unclassified failures and contradictory/misbound evidence in regression tests.
- [x] Implement pure B-provenance/weighting/fallback policy and minimal problematic-anchor selection.
- [x] Extend the scientific refiner with explicit observed-anchor mobility and source-centred positional restraints.
- [x] Implement generated-only stage 1 and default-enabled, opt-out stage 2 restarted from raw coordinates.
- [x] Version validation/provenance and preserve identity, nonmobile coordinates, geometry and all-L invariants.
- [x] Thread policy, opt-out, diagnostics and resume compatibility through CLI, runners, ZBS, Homology and GUI.
- [ ] Evaluate the new chain-normalized B formula against uniform and calibrate per-anchor movement bounds on a broader cohort.
- [x] Complete regression and workflow verification plus native 9CQD refinement replay; update user docs and generated schemas for the experimental integrated path (not broader scientific/default promotion).

The experimental software path is integrated; see
[native replay and custody verification](../research/staged-anchor-integration-v1.md).
The remaining broader-cohort item is scientific follow-up: numerical defaults
are approved engineering limits, not calibrated experimental uncertainty.

### Return to the real-complex findings

Evidence: [pre-anchor benchmark](../research/protein-complex-pre-anchor-benchmark-v1.md).
Execution and acceptance criteria are in the
[follow-up work packages](geometry-gated-anchor-relaxation-handoff.md#real-complex-follow-up-work-packages).
These are open follow-ups, not completed by merging the implementation.

- [ ] **1BRS D:64–65:** run an explicitly declared independent/sparse-context test with incomplete GLN D:58; preserve absent OE1/NE2 as unobserved rather than silently repairing the experimental source. Keep the original single-gap input refusal as a distinct result.
- [ ] **1GC1 G:397–409:** test resampling or fixed-anchor conformational search for the residual generated SER G:398 Ramachandran outlier. Retain the original failed seed; do not loosen geometry gates or release observed anchors without independent eligibility.
- [ ] **1HE8 A:322–352 and A:528–619:** profile the 240 s generated-only timeouts, then preregister a separate resource-budget experiment. Distinguish incomplete computation from geometry failure and preserve all raw evidence.
- [ ] **Live raw/final integration:** rerun a declared native MPS workflow after the raw-diagnostic fix, retaining complete sampler resource/probe provenance through refinement, publication and resume. Archived coordinate recovery does not close this acceptance item.

## API Phase 0: Decisions And Baseline

### Accepted Decisions

- [x] Accept an ADR making Node/TypeScript the HTTP, workspace, artifact, and job shell.
- [x] Accept an ADR making Python the sole owner of scientific naming policy.
- [x] Accept an ADR for host-neutral route composition rather than a duplicate Python web service.
- [x] Record `dvbfixer atom-names` as the dedicated naming command.
- [x] Record naming conversion as synchronous and long-running workflows as asynchronous jobs.
- [x] Record workspace artifact IDs as the only V1 server-side input reference.
- [x] Record the V1 policy rejecting multiple `MODEL` blocks.

### Open Maintainer Decisions

- [x] Select an authentication model.
- [x] Define principal-to-workspace authorization semantics.
- [x] Decide whether V1 needs direct upload/download conversion.
- [x] Decide whether HTTP should accept a JSON override artifact as well as inline overrides.
- [x] Decide whether `tleap-reduce` must honor the force-field naming option.

### Baseline Evidence

- [x] Add regression coverage for naming blockers 1-6 and 9 from the API roadmap.
- [x] Complete end-to-end nucleic-acid naming coverage.
- [x] Capture and document any still-needed representative golden inputs.
- [x] Complete ADR and test evidence distinguishing current behavior from intended V1 behavior.

## API Phase 1: Naming Application Service

### Application Boundary

- [x] Add typed naming request, result, diagnostic, target, profile, override, identity, and report vocabulary.
- [x] Implement `convert_force_field_naming` as PDB text in and transformed text plus report out.
- [x] Keep file I/O outside the pure service.
- [x] Retain the atomic in-place compatibility adapter for existing pipeline callers.
- [x] Report changed atoms, residues, variants, and atom names separately.
- [x] Keep naming conversion distinct from canonical `rename` and chemical parameterization.

### V1 Semantics And Correctness

- [x] Accept PDB text and support AMBER and CHARMM with the GROMACS profile.
- [x] Preserve exact, case-sensitive chain IDs and insertion codes.
- [x] Use typed three-field override identities and restrict legacy two-field identities to blank insertion codes.
- [x] Apply explicit override, explicit source variant, then no inferred change precedence.
- [x] Do not infer HID/HIE/HIP from canonical HIS alone.
- [x] Validate before returning or committing output and leave sources untouched on failure.
- [x] Reject multiple `MODEL` blocks.
- [x] Detect source and target atom-name collisions per residue.
- [x] Update correlated `ANISOU` and parseable full `TER` records.
- [x] Preserve unrelated records and non-name atom fields.
- [x] Support four-character CHARMM names and LYN/LSN hydrogen pairs idempotently.
- [x] Remove ambiguous two-field override fallback from the public service.
- [x] Add end-to-end DNA and RNA naming tests.
- [x] Document unvalidated terminal 5-prime/3-prime hydroxyl cases as unsupported.
- [x] Resolve `tleap-reduce` naming parity.
- [x] Document `standard` as suppressing shifts, not reversing GROMACS names.
- [x] Do not claim naming compatibility proves template or bond compatibility.

### Test Matrix

- [x] Verify every `GROMACS_AMBER_ATOM_RENAMES` mapping.
- [x] Verify AMBER and CHARMM caps and termini.
- [x] Verify exact coexistence of residues such as `H:82` and `H:82A`.
- [x] Verify one-residue and multi-chain proteins.
- [x] Verify byte-identical repeat conversion across all supported mappings.
- [x] Complete malformed-line coverage.
- [x] Complete `ATOM`, `HETATM`, `ANISOU`, `TER`, and untouched-record matrix coverage.
- [x] Verify empty/no-op conversion and report counts.

Evidence: `tests/test_force_field_naming.py` checks independent expected AMBER
spellings against the complete mapping inventory, both coordinate record types,
caps/termini, variant directions/profiles, DNA/RNA, repeated conversion, malformed
identity fields, correlated records, line endings, and report counts. This
verifies naming transformations, not chemical template or bond compatibility.

## API Phase 2: Dedicated CLI Adapter

- [x] Add `dvbfixer atom-names` with one input and one explicit output.
- [x] Add `--target-ff {amber,amber19sb,charmm}` and `--profile {gromacs,standard}`
  (native profile exposed publicly in 0.9.1; GROMACS remains the default).
- [x] Support variant overrides from JSON, `--dry-run`, and `--report-json`.
- [x] Call the pure naming service and keep the command distinct from `rename` and `convert`.
- [x] Register the command and regenerate CLI and GUI command references.
- [x] Add subprocess-level tests and deterministic conversion.
- [x] Explicitly verify source preservation at CLI level.
- [x] Explicitly validate the report schema at CLI level.
- [x] Explicitly verify non-zero exit and no destination on unsafe input.
- [x] Explicitly verify the selected CIF boundary behavior.

## API Phase 3: Versioned Naming API

### Core Vertical Slice

- [x] Add a V1 naming-conversion route with TypeBox runtime schemas and OpenAPI 3.1.
- [x] Resolve inputs by workspace artifact ID.
- [x] Invoke the Python command instead of duplicating naming rules in Node.
- [x] Validate bounded command reports and output digests.
- [x] Reload the current manifest before publication.
- [x] Register exactly one output with reproducible provenance and none for dry runs or failures.

### Request And Artifact Transaction

- [x] Return the output artifact and report.
- [x] Define and verify retained failure-log behavior.
- [x] Add bounded retention or pruning for failed operation directories.

Evidence: `gui/server/naming-retention.test.ts` and `naming-api.test.ts` verify
age/count pruning, workspace and symlink isolation, retained diagnostics,
configuration validation, and cleanup on subsequent successful execution.

### Provenance, Observability, And Tests

- [x] Record source, target, profile, overrides, report, and digest provenance.
- [x] Explicitly record command/service and DVBFixer package versions.
- [x] Add server-owned request IDs and structured API access logs.

- [x] Add durable audit events and retention.
- [x] Generate a client from OpenAPI.
- [x] Verify stable validation and error envelopes across V1 routes.
- [x] Add authentication and authorization tests after implementation.
- [x] Explicitly test path containment, source/request size limits, and naming timeouts.
- [x] Test artifact lookup, dry runs, one-artifact publication, concurrent manifests, and failures.
- [x] Validate OpenAPI examples against runtime schemas.

## API Phase 4: Standalone Server

### Local Standalone Host

- [x] Extract host-neutral route composition and keep Vite as a thin adapter.
- [x] Add a bundled Node entry point serving the built GUI and API.
- [x] Bind to loopback by default and require explicit insecure remote acknowledgment.
- [x] Validate host, port, roots, and shutdown configuration.
- [x] Reject lexical and symlink-resolved static/data root overlap.
- [x] Return JSON for unknown API paths and use SPA fallback only for HTML requests.
- [x] Stop intake, reject new work, terminate children, then drain HTTP.
- [x] Bound the emitted-server startup and shutdown smoke test.
- [x] Complete final review and verification of the standalone slice.
- [x] Commit the standalone slice.

### Public Deployment Hardening

- [x] Add authentication and principal-to-workspace authorization.
- [x] Add restrictive CORS.
- [x] Add upload and workspace limits plus process-wide child concurrency control.
- [x] Bound the process-wide child admission queue and reject overload before spawning.
- [x] Add bounded process-local request-rate limits before authentication.
- [x] Add OS-level CPU, memory, and filesystem quotas.
  - [x] Add a fail-closed systemd/cgroup-v2 deployment profile and bounded-storage preflight.
  - [x] Run privileged kernel-enforcement acceptance tests on the Ubuntu 24.04 reference deployment host in CI.
- [x] Document current local deployment and security boundaries.
- [x] Document the supported single-host public-deployment profile after security controls exist.
- [x] Add storage-level manifest locking or compare-and-swap.
- [x] Replace process-local locks and event subscribers for multi-instance operation.
- [x] Complete reference public-deployment smoke tests through HTTPS on the CI VM.

## API Phase 5: General DVBFixer API

### Route And Contract Policy

- [x] Version managed-job routes under `/api/v1`.
- [x] Retire the duplicate synchronous generic command route.
- [x] Classify every operation as a deterministic transform or managed workflow.
- [x] Keep minimization, modeling, and parameterization out of synchronous APIs.
- [x] Preserve cancellation for long-running operations.
- [x] Generate clients and contract tests from OpenAPI.
- [x] Define API compatibility, versioning, and deprecation policy.
- [x] Add durable scheduling, state, and event delivery before horizontal scaling.

### Operation Rollout

- [x] Expose `diagnose`.
- [x] Expose `conect`.
- [x] Expose `renumber`.
- [x] Version or migrate managed `prepare`, `minimize`, `model`, and `zbs`.

## API-Wide Quality Gates

- [x] Use one runtime-schema source for every V1 route and OpenAPI description.
- [x] Ensure no public route accepts unrestricted filesystem paths.
- [x] Keep scientific naming policy implemented once in Python.
- [x] Record reproducible inputs, options, and versions for every output artifact.
- [x] Enforce workspace ownership before path resolution.
- [x] Return structured reports for every exposed operation.
- [x] Require durable workflow state before horizontal scaling.
- [x] Adopt one common V1 error envelope and explicit compatibility policy.
- [x] Test status mappings for 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 413, 415, 422, and 500.
- [x] Stabilize documented naming error codes.
- [x] Run release verification: GUI checks, focused Python tests, generated-file checks, agent-doc checks, and the non-slow Python suite.
- [x] Push the completed implementation and require every configured GitHub Actions CI check on that commit to pass.

Verification on 2026-09-21: the [post-push CI run for `cf56aaa`](https://github.com/lilpoundcake/DVBFixer/actions/runs/35661988827)
passed all four configured jobs. The scientific lane reported 552 passed and
3 skipped (no Modeller license); GUI reported 232 passed. Locally, the
non-slow Python suite reported 533 passed and 3 skipped, and the Python 3.11
fast-lane selection reported 220 passed. Ruff, mypy, TypeScript, generated
CLI/GUI/OpenAPI files, agent-doc validation, and `git diff --check` passed.
Python 3.13 changes argparse help formatting, so CI pins its scientific lane
to Python 3.11. This verification does not include licensed Modeller
integrations or target-host public-deployment acceptance.

Reference deployment acceptance on 2026-09-22: the
[Ubuntu 24.04 CI run for `b72e477`](https://github.com/lilpoundcake/DVBFixer/actions/runs/35695278505)
passed its new privileged deployment job. The systemd service's mandatory
preflight accepted a dedicated ext4 data mount, read-only root, private tmpfs,
CPUQuota=200%, MemoryMax=16 GiB, MemorySwapMax=0, and TasksMax=512. Scaled
probes recorded `cpu.stat nr_throttled` 1→31, `memory.events oom_kill` 0→1,
and `pids.events max` 0→2; writes stopped at the data and temporary filesystem
limits, and stopping the unit removed a session-detached child. HTTPS smoke
covered health, required bearer auth, CORS rejection, and workspace creation;
MAFFT, tleap, and Reduce produced output under a contained unit. These results
validate the Ubuntu reference profile, not an operator's future production host;
the installation-specific acceptance in `docs/deployment.md` remains required.

The versioned workflow API uses a durable workspace run lock, cross-process
cancel markers, and persisted job-record polling for SSE on a shared local
filesystem. `docs/adr/0009-versioned-workflows-and-compatibility.md` defines
the V1 error and deprecation policy. Horizontal scaling across multiple hosts
remains explicitly unsupported until an external scheduler/state store exists;
these checked workflow-state items cover one-host multi-process operation.

## Diffusion Gap Reconstruction

- [x] Complete Phase 0: policy, license inventory, corpus, leakage metadata, and predeclared thresholds.
- [x] Complete Phase 1: backend-neutral contract, masks, Kabsch/reinjection primitives, fake runner, validation, provenance, and atomic publication.
- [x] Complete Phase 2: pinned RFdiffusion v1 Linux/NVIDIA benchmark adapter and minimal digest-pinned container recipe; final container build/GPU smoke awaits a host with an OCI runtime.
- [x] Complete Phase 3: select Protenix v1 through the all-atom constrained-sampler ablation and 231-group confirmatory benchmark; retain Boltz-2 as proxy-only.
- [x] Record the confirmatory result: Protenix 220/231, MODELLER 169/231, noninferiority demonstrated, and `candidate-preferred` decision.
- [x] Deliver the Phase 4 experimental `model --backend diffusion` implementation while retaining
  MODELLER as the default and without automatic fallback. Public CLI, production
  wrappers, additive Doctor preflight, fail-closed batch/GUI admission,
  record-preserving candidate materialization, and portable protocol failure
  handling are implemented and tested. Public cc89 CUDA and corrected Apple
  integration each pass 5/5 within their bounded scope.
- [ ] Complete the selected Protenix production-wrapper 231-case replay and final
  OCI image build/GPU smoke; profile-lock pinning and public GPU smokes already exist.
- [x] Deliver mosaic-first Homology with authoritative template coordinates,
  coverage ownership, CLI/GUI routing and bounded public integration evidence.
- [ ] Complete the larger independent Homology/context/edit evaluation before
  claiming broader scientific acceptance.
- [ ] Complete Phase 6: separate evidence-backed production decision.
- [x] Execute the macOS Apple Silicon CPU/MPS portability evaluation separately
  from Linux/NVIDIA acceptance and remote-runner evidence; all 231 frozen cases
  reached terminal outcomes with fallback disabled, with 213/231 selected passes.
- [x] After native GPU gates pass, define the external NVIDIA Docker runner with a digest-pinned base and digest-verified mounted checkpoint.
- [ ] Build and GPU-smoke the final image when an OCI runtime is available; defer registry signing, multi-arch, embedded weights, and orchestration until deployment creates those requirements.
- [x] Complete compact-model Linux scientific selection, the 231-case
  Protpardelle descriptive follow-up, and the frozen Apple Silicon CPU/MPS
  portability matrix on the physical Mac.
- [x] Complete Protpardelle-1c artifact audit, Linux CPU/CUDA operator smoke,
  initial three-residue withheld-coordinate pilot, and frozen six-case v5 pilot;
  generated-only CPU refinement raises the latter from `2/6` to `6/6` hard-gate
  passes, while training-membership leakage remains unresolved.
- [x] Complete the preregistered 24-case compact-model extension: raw
  Protpardelle passes `13/24`, refinement alone passes `21/24`, and validation-
  first raw/refined selection passes `22/24` versus Protenix `23/24` and MODELLER
  `21/24`; keep the result exploratory because training leakage is unresolved.
- [x] Add and exercise the optional Protpardelle post-update callback. Corrected
  internal-frame reinjection is byte-identical across two same-seed `9dvi` runs
  and exact for all 569 represented fixed atoms, but does not improve raw geometry;
  OpenMM CPU refinement passes while remaining measurably nondeterministic.
- [x] Run corrected per-step reinjection over the frozen 24-case compact follow-up.
  Exact callback control passes all operational checks, but validation-first
  coverage is `21/24` versus `22/24` for final-only projection, so per-step
  reinjection is not selected as the compact baseline.
- [x] Diagnose OpenMM's CUDA PTX failure and add an isolated CUDA-12.2-compatible
  refinement environment with digest-verified ff19SB data. Two byte-identical
  `9dvi` runs and the 440-residue `9ina` run pass every CUDA hard gate. This historical
  kernel diagnostic preceded the completed 231-case follow-up recorded below.
- [x] Freeze the full 231-case Protpardelle descriptive-follow-up manifest before
  cohort-wide inference, with 128 gap-5 and 103 gap-10 cases, CUDA refinement,
  validation-first selection, digest-tracked code/environment inputs, and no
  replacement of failures.
- [x] Preserve the stopped v5 full-run manifest after its internal CUDA
  fixed-particle tolerance rejected `35zr`; pass the v6 standalone gate and
  freeze a successor manifest before a clean namespace restart without changing
  sampling, physical refinement, validation, selection, or cohort membership.
- [x] Complete the clean v6 231-case follow-up: Protpardelle raw passes `101/231`,
  CUDA-refined and validation-first selected output pass `217/231`; retain Linux
  evidence as immutable comparator data for the Apple portability study.
- [x] Complete the staged Apple Silicon handoff: explicit CPU/MPS device
  selection, fallback-disabled operator smoke, same-seed repeat, six-case gate,
  24-case portability pilot, 100-case operational soak, and full frozen 231-case
  run. Evidence remains descriptive because training membership is unresolved.
- [ ] Benchmark at most two adapted pretrained compact candidates before training a purpose-built local gap model.
- [ ] Train and freeze a leakage-controlled gap-only model only after the public-structure dataset and sequence-cluster splits are immutable.
- [ ] Require withheld-coordinate noninferiority and Apple memory/latency gates before any local experimental backend decision.

Detailed requirements and acceptance gates are in the
[diffusion gap-reconstruction plan](diffusion-gap-reconstruction.md).

### CUDA expansion follow-up (2026-10-19)

- [x] Share profile-specific gap-length admission across CLI, mosaic construction,
  and scientific scope; preserve separate public and research capabilities.
- [x] Independently audit withheld accuracy of all 50 full-input clean-protein
  CUDA outcomes, including rejected candidates and native-quality exclusions.
- [x] Validate adaptive queries and previous source context; do not report a
  context expansion when the policy selects no additional atoms.
- [x] Exercise deletion flanks 1–5 and reject invalid Homology requests before
  writing the normalized candidate input.
- [x] Freeze and execute generated-only CUDA refinement for all six rich cc89
  frontier outputs; retain 0/6 acceptance and two guarded chirality exceptions.
- [x] Diagnose the original catastrophic cc89 failure with frozen tensor/axis
  controls and implement an explicit CUDA-only neutral denoiser chain-phase mode.
- [x] Confirm all six repaired candidates match causal controls byte-for-byte;
  unchanged generated-only CUDA refinement accepts 6/6 at 0.17–0.25 Å RMSD.
- [x] Complete the 13-source, 30-mask known-sequence follow-up: 60 cc89 raw and
  refinement outcomes, 30 MODELLER comparisons, four public Homology/Protenix
  controls, exact masked-template checks, and independent artifact revalidation.
- [x] Record the negative broad-scope result without changing thresholds or
  replacing failures: cc89 37/60 after refinement, including 0/16 CDR outcomes;
  retain three guarded chirality failures. Public Protenix controls pass 4/4.
- [x] Audit actual first-attention chain/position features, raw prefit tensors,
  frame conversions and native oracle round trips; distinguish packing from
  false peptide adjacency and from whole-complex sampling misuse.
- [x] Implement explicit CUDA source-physical position features and local-input
  correction; recheck all 16 original CDR mask/seed pairs with unchanged
  refinement: 16/16 pass, median backbone RMSD 1.152 Å. Preserve the original
  negative holdout and label the correction as diagnostic, not independent acceptance.
- [x] Complete and independently audit all 44 corrected general-protein outcomes:
  44/44 pass after unchanged refinement, retaining all 37 original passes and
  recovering seven failures. Combined corrected acceptance is 60/60, zero D-Cα,
  and exact outside-gap preservation. Record paired raw/final transitions;
  treat reference RMSD as secondary rather than an acceptance criterion.
- [x] Freeze and independently revalidate the first source-disjoint corrected-mode
  check: 9WW8, gaps 5/10, seeds 7/19, 4/4 after unchanged refinement. Keep the
  source denominator explicit and freeze a separate expanded CDR/general cohort.
- [x] Complete the frozen 8EK6/9Z0U/9LDN prospective cohort and independent audit:
  20/20 pass after unchanged refinement. Combined prospective acceptance is
  24/24 across four new sources, zero detectable D-Cα and exact outside-gap
  preservation; keep separate from the development recheck.
- [ ] Complete prospective long-gap noninferiority and independent review.
- [x] Expose corrected cc89 as the public Linux/NVIDIA `protpardelle-1c-cuda`
  profile for one internal 5–10-residue gap, automatic fixed-policy local context,
  isolated CUDA refinement, CLI/GUI routing, exact bundle validation and resume.
  Public model/Homology integration accepts 5/5 candidates across four workflows.
- [ ] Complete wider independent cc89 CUDA acceptance beyond the corrected
  development recheck, bounded four-source prospective check and public integration.
- [ ] Complete larger independently reviewed context/CDR and Homology edit cohorts.

Evidence: [CUDA expansion completion audit](../research/cuda-expansion-completion.md).
Follow-up: [cc89 chain-phase diagnosis](../research/cc89-chain-phase-root-cause.md).
Expanded follow-up: [known-sequence structural holdout](../research/cc89-known-sequence-holdout.md).
Input correction: [representation audit](../research/cc89-input-representation-audit.md).
Apple follow-up completed in `0e2a8c8`: corrected research pilot 8/8 and versioned
`protpardelle-1c-mps-local-v1` public integration 5/5, including multi-seed publication
and exact frozen-request replay; historical MPS semantics remain separate.
- [ ] Complete the larger corrected-Apple memory/latency/operational cohort before
  wider acceptance. See [Apple public evidence](../research/cc89-public-apple-acceptance.md).

## DDD Documentation Roadmap

### Phases 0-2: Foundation And Domain Contexts

- [x] Define source precedence, statuses, references, delegation, and ownership rules.
- [x] Use dependency-free TOML maps and validate syntax, links, IDs, and evidence in CI.
- [x] Map force-field naming callers, boundaries, contracts, invariants, and known gaps.
- [x] Add Force-Field Naming, Structure Identity, and Parameterization contexts.
- [x] Add their task, contract, invariant, and change-group records.
- [x] Give every `dvbfixer.domain` export an active meaning or explicit vocabulary-only status.

### Phases 3-4: Artifacts And Pipelines

- [x] Document `.dat`, structure identity, connectivity, workspace, Homology, and topology artifacts.
- [x] Record owners, producers, consumers, keys, mutation policy, atomicity, cleanup, and failure behavior.
- [x] Add Structure Preparation, Topology Generation, Diagnostics, and Workflow Execution contexts.
- [x] Document boundaries without copying algorithms and reconcile cross-context contradictions.

### Phases 5-6: Tasks And Validation

- [x] Index high-risk `.dat`, rebuild, CONECT, topology, workspace, API, and fixture changes.
- [x] Add new task records only when repeated high-risk work justifies them.
- [x] Validate TOML, metadata, paths, Markdown, linked records, evidence, sections, and indexed pages.
- [x] Add symbol checks, stale-commit reporting, generated views, or PR checks only when justified.
- [x] Keep a general Python/TypeScript AST index out of the initial rollout.

### Ongoing Maintenance

- [x] Use `docs/agent/README.md` as the canonical agent-map entry point.
- [x] Maintain shared maps, contexts, validator, and tests through one coordinating editor.
- [x] Separate implemented behavior from vocabulary, proposals, research, and gaps.
- [x] Surface unresolved contradictions instead of choosing silently.
- [x] Add context pages only when structured records cannot explain the concern.
- [x] Run agent-doc validation and `git diff --check` after every map change.
