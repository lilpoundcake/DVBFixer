# API and DDD continuation context

Current completion status is tracked in the canonical
[implementation checklist](implementation-checklist.md). This file remains a
historical handoff record rather than an implementation tracker.

Last updated: 2026-09-18.

Purpose: give a future coding session enough verified context to continue the
API and DDD work without repeating repository discovery. This is a handoff
record, not a public contract. Proposed decisions remain proposals until an ADR
is accepted and code exists.

## Requested outcome

The initial request covered planning, followed by implementation of the first
LLM-oriented documentation slice:

1. Plan a DVBFixer API.
2. Prioritize an API for GROMACS-compatible atom naming.
3. Plan adoption of Domain-Driven Design documentation.
4. Preserve enough context for later implementation.
5. Add a validated task/contract/invariant map for coding agents.

Documents created in this pass:

- [DVBFixer API roadmap](api-roadmap.md)
- [DDD documentation roadmap](ddd-documentation-roadmap.md)
- this continuation context
- [`../agent/`](../agent/) knowledge maps and Force-field Naming context

The initial planning pass changed no scientific production code. The follow-up
DDD slice now implements the pure naming application service and legacy file
adapter described below. CLI arguments and generated references remain
unchanged; documentation validation and its lightweight CI check remain active.

## Verified current state

### Naming implementation

- `src/dvbfixer/ffutils/ff_names.py::apply_variants_to_pdb_text` is the shared
  implementation relevant to GROMACS-compatible names.
- It mutates a PDB file in place and returns the number of changed atom lines.
- It accepts `target_ff="amber"` or `"charmm"` and an
  `include_gromacs_shifts` switch.
- It restores explicit residue variants and applies atom-name mappings for
  AMBER methylenes, termini, caps, nucleic acids, and CHARMM backbone/caps.
- It is called by legacy paths in prepare, minimize, and protonate.
- `zbs` forwards atom-naming options to prepare and minimize.
- The `tleap-reduce` early-return paths in prepare/protonate do not apply the
  final naming helper. A later minimize can mask this in some ZBS workflows.

Important distinction:

- `src/dvbfixer/rename.py` canonicalizes residue names such as `HIE` to `HIS`.
- It does not perform GROMACS-compatible atom naming.
- Do not expose or rename that operation as the planned naming conversion.

### Naming risks and implementation status

- The pure service rejects multiple `MODEL` blocks before conversion.
- The pure service requires typed three-field residue identity. The legacy
  wrapper accepts two-tuples only as exact blank-insertion-code identities.
- Target atom-name collisions are rejected during preflight validation.
- Correlated `ANISOU` and parseable full `TER` labels are updated consistently.
- Four-character CHARMM residue names and `LYN` to `LSN` atom-pair conversion
  are idempotent under repeated conversion with the same overrides.
- End-to-end nucleic-acid naming coverage is incomplete; terminal hydroxyl
  cases are explicitly unverified.
- `standard` suppresses shifts; it is not a reverse conversion from existing
  GROMACS names.
- Naming compatibility is not proof of force-field template/bond compatibility.

Tests already worth extending:

- `tests/test_ff_names.py`
- `tests/test_variants_gromacs_lyn.py`
- `tests/test_terminal_caps.py`
- `tests/test_rename.py`

### Existing HTTP/backend implementation

- `gui/server/api-routes.ts` is the shared composition root; `api-plugin.ts` and
  `standalone.ts` are the Vite and Node hosts.
- `gui/server/workspace-api.ts` owns versioned workspace manifests, contained
  paths, atomic writes, imports/downloads, and recoverable trash.
- `gui/server/managed-jobs.ts` owns persisted job records, one active run per
  workspace, cancellation, polling, and SSE.
- `gui/server/dvbfixer-runner.ts` invokes the CLI with timeout, abort,
  output-size bounds, and process-group termination.
- `gui/server/command-args.ts` allowlists command arguments from generated
  definitions.
- `gui/server/api-routes.ts` still contains a duplicate synchronous generic
  `/api/dvbfixer/:command` path. The GUI primarily uses managed jobs.
- The naming API has TypeBox runtime schemas and OpenAPI; legacy routes remain
  unversioned. Static bearer authentication and manifest-backed workspace
  authorization are implemented.
- Active locks and SSE subscribers are process-local, so the job system is not
  ready for multi-instance deployment.
- The build ships a loopback-default standalone host for the GUI and APIs.

Relevant backend tests:

- `gui/server/workspace-api.test.ts`
- `gui/server/managed-jobs.test.ts`
- `gui/server/dvbfixer-runner.test.ts`
- `gui/server/request-body.test.ts`
- `gui/server/generated-spec.test.ts`
- `gui/server/homology-api.test.ts`

### Existing domain model

- `src/dvbfixer/domain/structure_identity.py` owns immutable identity vocabulary
  and chain-ID allocation policy.
- `src/dvbfixer/domain/parameterization.py` owns parameterization route policy
  and the complex-cofactor guard.
- `src/dvbfixer/domain/__init__.py` exports those concepts.
- Active adapters include `src/dvbfixer/molecule_chains.py` and
  `src/dvbfixer/lig_params.py`.
- `docs/domain-model.md` and the first section of `ARCHITECTURE.md` explicitly
  call DDD partial and focused.
- `tests/test_scientific_domain.py` covers the existing domain policies.

Do not describe parsing, topology construction, atom matching, minimization, or
all five parameterization route labels as fully migrated domain implementations.

## Proposed decisions in the roadmaps

These are recommendations, not accepted ADRs:

1. Keep Node/TypeScript as the HTTP, workspace, artifact, and job shell.
2. Keep Python as the sole owner of scientific naming policy.
3. Extract route composition from Vite rather than create a duplicate Python
   web service.
4. Introduce a pure Python naming service: text in, transformed text plus a
   structured report out.
5. Keep file I/O in adapters and make API output non-destructive and atomic.
6. Add a dedicated CLI adapter rather than overload `dvbfixer rename`.
7. Make the first endpoint synchronous because naming conversion is a bounded
   text transformation; retain managed jobs for long-running workflows.
8. Make V1 workspace-scoped and reference input by artifact ID, never by a raw
   server path.
9. Publish `/api/v1` plus OpenAPI generated from the runtime validation schema.
10. Document Force-field Naming as the first new bounded context.

Decisions still requiring maintainer agreement:

- Whether direct upload/download conversion is needed in V1 or only after the
  workspace-artifact vertical slice.
- Whether the HTTP route should later accept a JSON override artifact in
  addition to its implemented inline override array.

## Recommended next implementation session

Phases 2, the core Phase 3 naming slice, the local standalone host, and static
bearer/workspace authorization are implemented. Continue with the remaining
security and distributed-systems concerns.

1. Add rate and OS-level resource limits beyond the implemented restrictive
   CORS, upload/workspace limits, and process-wide child concurrency control.
2. Add structured request logs, metrics, audit retention, and a generated client.
3. Add a storage-level manifest lock or compare-and-swap before multi-instance
   deployment.

Do not add an HTTP handler around `apply_variants_to_pdb_text`. It remains an
in-place compatibility adapter; public adapters must use the pure naming
application boundary and create a new output artifact.

## Likely code touch points

Python core and CLI:

- `src/dvbfixer/domain/force_field_naming.py`
- `src/dvbfixer/force_field_naming.py`
- `src/dvbfixer/ffutils/ff_names.py`
- `src/dvbfixer/command_registry.py`
- `src/dvbfixer/cli.py`
- `src/dvbfixer/prepare/pipeline.py`
- `src/dvbfixer/minimize/pipeline.py`
- `src/dvbfixer/protonate.py`
- `src/dvbfixer/zbs.py`
- `tests/test_ff_names.py`
- new CLI/application tests

Generated/documentation surfaces after argparse changes:

- `scripts/gen_cli_reference.py`
- `scripts/gen_gui_spec.py`
- `docs/reference/`
- `gui/server/generated-dvbfixer-spec.ts`

HTTP server:

- `gui/server/api-plugin.ts`
- a new host-neutral API composition module
- a new production server entry point
- `gui/server/workspace-api.ts`
- `gui/server/managed-jobs.ts`
- `gui/server/dvbfixer-runner.ts`
- request/response schema and OpenAPI generation modules
- route and contract tests

DDD documentation:

- `docs/domain-model.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/agent/` knowledge maps and context pages
- API ADRs and Force-field Naming context page first

## Repository rules that matter

- Preserve `keepIds=True` on `PDBFile.writeFile` calls.
- Never collapse `(chain, resid, icode)` identities to two-tuples.
- Chain IDs are case-sensitive.
- Do not hand-edit `docs/reference/*.md`; regenerate them.
- Scientific materialization belongs in Python, not React/Node route handlers.
- Use `DatRecord` for `.dat` files rather than hand-written JSON loading.
- Preserve workspace isolation and revision-conflict rebasing semantics.
- Do not modify unrelated untracked files. At discovery time the worktree
  already contained untracked `.claude/`, force-field directories, and
  `mini.yml`; they were not touched by this planning work.

## Verification commands for future code work

Focused Python tests should be run first. Candidate sequence:

```bash
pytest -q tests/test_ff_names.py tests/test_variants_gromacs_lyn.py tests/test_terminal_caps.py
python scripts/gen_cli_reference.py --check
python scripts/gen_gui_spec.py --check
ruff check src/dvbfixer
mypy src/dvbfixer/cli.py src/dvbfixer/ffutils src/dvbfixer/pdbutils src/dvbfixer/align.py
pytest -m 'not slow' -q
```

GUI/backend verification from `gui/`:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test -- --run
```

For documentation-only changes, validate relative Markdown links and inspect
`git diff --check` plus the final diff.

## Completion marker for this pass

- Repository discovery: complete.
- API plan: complete as a proposal.
- DDD documentation plan: revised for LLM navigation.
- Agent-map foundation, seven contexts, core artifact contracts, high-risk task
  groups, and cross-cutting invariants: implemented.
- Continuation context: complete.
- API implementation: Phase 1 pure naming application service implemented;
  dedicated CLI and HTTP adapters not started.
- Accepted API ADRs: not started; the implemented service establishes the
  technical naming boundary and V1 multi-model policy, which should be recorded
  before the public command ships.
