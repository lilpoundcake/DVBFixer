# User documentation refresh

## Scope

Reorganize the existing English user manual around tasks, without changing
scientific behavior or hand-editing generated CLI references. Keep existing
page paths and useful heading anchors wherever possible.

## Work plan

- [x] Add `docs/README.md`, `docs/quick-start.md`, and `docs/gui.md`.
- [x] Simplify the root README and installation entry path.
- [x] Make pipelines the canonical recipe collection; reduce BEST_PRACTICES to navigation.
- [x] Normalize command introductions, navigation, examples, and reference links.
- [x] Separate user troubleshooting from development/research details.
- [x] Add a documentation style guide and automated Markdown/link checks.
- [x] Validate rendered structure, examples, generated references, and agent maps.

Additional files: `docs/known-issues-history.md` preserves the old investigation
notes; `docs/maintenance/documentation-style.md` documents the maintenance policy.
The checker and its regression tests are `scripts/check_user_docs.py` and
`tests/test_user_docs.py`; the lightweight CI lane runs both.

## Link tracking

### Profile-installation alignment (2026-11-05)

Scope: update the existing README, installation, quick-start and two GUI guides;
extend `tests/test_user_docs.py`. No new guide pages or scientific changes.

- [x] Make the Standard/Desktop helper the primary installation route.
- [x] Use matching prefix activation, protected licensing and profile Doctor checks.
- [x] Separate manual/editable development from installed Desktop launch.
- [x] Validate maintained links, documentation regressions and generated references.

No new link targets are planned; retain existing installation anchors.
The README uses the existing interactive helper without explicit prefix/activation
paths; detailed guides retain prefix examples. Installer behavior is unchanged.
README claims were checked against bootstrap/install code, the profile catalog,
GUI launcher and preparation output naming. Manual Standard activation now matches
the generated environment name. Verification: 60 focused documentation,
environment, profile, installer and launcher tests passed; 43 maintained user
pages passed link/Markdown checks. Release metadata, license-inventory freshness,
agent maps and generated CLI/GUI checks passed. This was not a fresh scientific
installation or native shortcut acceptance run.

All planned pages exist. The link checker validates local paths and Markdown
heading anchors across maintained user documentation. There are no pending local
links. Existing technical/research documents are preserved, not rewritten as
part of this pass. Existing inbound links to changed user-page anchors were
also checked across tracked Markdown files; no missing anchors were found.

## Acceptance

- Installation and first-run instructions do not require architecture/research reading.
- Recipes use connected filenames and identify optional steps separately.
- Command pages start with purpose and a usable example before advanced details.
- User documentation has consistent navigation and passes automated checks.
- CLI references remain generated and synchronized with argparse.

## Verification results

- User Markdown/link/anchor/JSON checks: 38 pages passed.
- Focused documentation, agent-map, and environment tests: 13 passed.
- Ruff on production Python plus the new checker/tests: passed.
- CLI reference and GUI schema `--check`: passed; generated files unchanged.
- Long-option spellings in 220 documented shell invocations checked against the
  generated CLI references: passed (static verification, not execution).
- Release metadata and agent maps: passed.
- CommonMark + GFM-table rendering: 38 pages, 62 tables, 139 fenced blocks;
  HTML previews generated in private temporary storage. This is a parser/render
  check, not a browser screenshot or narrow-window visual acceptance.
- Scientific example smoke on tracked ubiquitin `1UBQ.pdb`: prepare → minimize
  with matching `.dat` and `--no-solvent` → diagnose → native AMBER naming all
  returned 0 and produced their expected artifacts. No fixture inputs changed.
- Complete recipe coverage is not claimed: glycoprotein, topology export,
  external-builder, and experimental runner recipes were not all executed.
- Fast Python suite: 1,342 passed, 2 optional skips, 31 slow tests deselected.
  The final documentation contract test was also included in the subsequent
  focused run reported above.

## Quality report

The user entry path is now installation → quick start → task recipes/GUI.
All 24 command guides have a consistent title, navigation, reference link, and
quick-start section near the top, enforced by a metadata-only regression test.
The recipes distinguish optional re-protonation from required preparation,
use explicit connected filenames, and explain vacuum-minimization scope.
Known issues are symptom-based; resolved implementation investigations are
archived separately. Shared batch/logging/numbering behavior has one guide.
No scientific behavior, dependencies, generated references, or release version
were changed.
