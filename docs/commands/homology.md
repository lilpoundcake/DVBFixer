# `dvbfixer homology`

[User guide](../README.md) · [Command index](index.md) · [CLI reference](../reference/homology.md)

Builds a target model from a full-length FASTA and structurally related templates.
Use [model](model.md) instead for gaps in an existing structure.

## Quick start

```bash
dvbfixer homology target.fasta --template template.pdb
```

**Inputs:** a target FASTA and one or more template structures. **Result:** modeled
coordinates and workflow files named from the FASTA stem, or the prefix selected
with `-o`. Inspect assignments and modeled regions before downstream preparation.
MODELLER requires a license.

## Template selection

GUI users should also read the comprehensive
[GUI Homology Workspace guide](../gui-homology.md).

Multi-template homology modeling with Modeller. Takes a target FASTA (multi-chain) and one or more template PDB files. Auto-aligns target to templates via pairwise `align2d` per chain (or `--salign` for structure-based). Each target chain is modeled independently against its best template chain, then assembled into a multi-chain PDB. Point mutations are handled naturally by the differing target sequence. Antibody mode (`--antibody`): uses ANARCI for Kabat/IMGT numbering, CDR detection, and auto-mapping of Fv/constant domains to different templates.

Loop refinement is used when the alignment contains modelable gaps. If
Modeller reports that a fully covered alignment has no loops, DVBfixer
automatically retries that build with ordinary `automodel`; this is a normal
no-loop case and does not require `--no-loop-refine` from the user.

### Selected template parts

`--template-plan plan.json` is the coordinate-preserving workflow used by the
GUI. DVBfixer structurally fits template chains by target chain, resolves the
painted alignment-column ranges, and merges them into one mosaic template
before invoking Modeller. This prevents Modeller from independently moving
non-overlapping fragment templates. Do not combine `--template-plan` with
`--template` or `--alignment`; the plan produces both internally.

With `--backend diffusion`, the template plan instead feeds the authoritative
`selected_template_mosaic.pdb` through an exact coverage-derived request to the selected isolated Protenix or
Protpardelle runner (or the host-compatible installed model under auto selection).
DVBFixer exports `selected_template_mosaic.coverage.json`, preserves the
zero-based half-open masks and earlier-template-wins ownership, maps logical
target IDs such as `VH`/`VL` to distinct PDB chains, and records each covered
residue's template owner in request and publication provenance. Covered residues
whose amino-acid identity matches the target are fixed exactly; only uncovered
regions admitted by the normal diffusion scope are generated. New mosaic requests
also use [geometry-gated anchor repair](model.md#geometry-gated-refinement-and-observed-anchors):
`--no-relax-anchors` disables observed-anchor release, and
`--no-anchor-bfactor-weighting` selects uniform restraints. The original ownership
and generated masks remain distinct from any released observed anchors. A covered
substitution fails closed by default. With explicit
`--diffusion-regenerate-covered`, substitutions and deletion boundaries regenerate
bounded windows, expanding short windows to at least three residues and rejecting
merged windows longer than twelve. Template ownership of regenerated covered
residues is recorded separately from fixed template ownership. Atoms outside the
declared windows remain fixed. Positions come directly from coverage, without
FASTA re-alignment, so repeated sequence blocks cannot move the masks.

`--diffusion-edit-flanks 1..5` sets the covered-edit window explicitly and requires
`--diffusion-regenerate-covered`. A single internal deletion boundary produces
windows of 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 residues before overlaps are merged. For example,
`--diffusion-edit-flanks 3` uses three flanking target residues on either side
of the boundary residue. Window size is not retried automatically after a
geometry rejection. The frozen CUDA example passed with three flanks; this does
not guarantee closure for another deletion or scaffold.

Protenix `--diffusion-context local|full` supports multiple uncovered spans and
jointly sampled gap-bearing chains, including distinct logical `VH`/`VL` mappings.
Every group still requires a chain from the common reference structure. Multiple
templates are fitted and merged before inference. Corrected Protpardelle CUDA and
`protpardelle-1c-mps-local-v1` default to source-only local context for one CYS-free
internal 5–10-residue gap in at most 512 whole-source canonical residues. Physical
source positions preserve discontiguous spans; Apple uses separate CPU refinement.
The context is finalized before the coverage-derived request is frozen; replay
never repairs or silently changes an incomplete request. Explicit `none`/`full`
is rejected by these corrected profiles. Legacy Protpardelle MPS explicit context
retains its one-gap-bearing-chain/one-contiguous-span-per-source-chain restriction.
Unsupported mappings fail before runner launch. There is no fallback
to Modeller. These remain experimental capabilities subject to independent
geometry validation and the frozen context/Homology acceptance studies.

For multi-chain targets, every group must include a chain from the first

Modeller is required for the Modeller backend. ANARCI is required only for `--antibody`. Automatic
multi-template mode maps each target chain to its best template chain;
`--template-plan` instead materializes the explicitly selected aligned ranges.
The Modeller output is the best-ranked PDB plus a matching `.dat` restraint
sidecar for downstream `prepare`/`minimize`. Diffusion writes an atomic directory
bundle named `<PREFIX>_homology_diffusion`; accepted and rejected bundles retain
the same validation/provenance semantics as `model --backend diffusion`.
`--prepare` and `--minimize` copy the first independently validated ranked PDB
and its canonical `.dat` into a separate downstream handoff, preserving the
complete bundle. They fail closed on scientific rejection. `--antibody` remains
unsupported with diffusion. Logical plan target IDs remain case-sensitive and
are not truncated before coverage/ownership validation.

## How it works

Multi-template homology modeling with Modeller. Takes a target FASTA (multi-chain) and one or more template PDB files. Auto-aligns target to templates via Modeller's `align2d` (or `salign` with `--salign`). Builds model with `automodel` or `LoopModel` using multiple `knowns`. Point mutations handled naturally by differing target sequence from templates. Post-processing restores chain IDs and residue numbering. Writes `.dat` file for downstream `prepare`/`minimize` restraints. `--prepare` and `--minimize` flags run the full pipeline automatically. Antibody mode (`--antibody`): uses ANARCI for Kabat/IMGT numbering, CDR detection, VH/VL/CH/CL domain classification, and auto-mapping of Fv from one template + constant domains from another. Dependencies: Modeller (required), ANARCI (for `--antibody` mode).

## Batch mode

`homology` does not support directory batch input because each run requires an
explicit query, templates, and alignment relationship. Run it once per modeling
job. See the [batch support matrix](../batch-mode.md#support-by-tool).
