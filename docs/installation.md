# Installation

[← README](../README.md)

Create the environment and install:

```bash
micromamba create -f environment.yml
micromamba activate dvbfixer
pip install -e .
```

**Modeller license:** The `model` command requires Modeller, which needs a free academic license key. Register at https://salilab.org/modeller/registration.html, then set the key in `<env>/lib/modeller-10.8/modlib/modeller/config.py`.

After installation, `dvbfixer` is available as a CLI command:

```bash
dvbfixer <command> [options]
```

Or without activating the environment:

```bash
micromamba run -n dvbfixer dvbfixer <command> [options]
```
