"""Regression tests for the seeded/retried `PDBFixer.addMissingAtoms()`
rebuild (`dvbfixer.ffutils.geometry.rebuild_missing_atoms_with_retry`).

Root cause (2026-07): `PDBFixer.addMissingAtoms(seed=None)` rebuilds a
missing sidechain via template-overlay + a short local minimization; if
the result clashes with a neighbor (< 0.13 nm, PDBFixer's own
`_findNearestDistance` cutoff), it falls back to UNSEEDED Langevin
dynamics (300 K, up to 2000 steps) to kick the new atoms apart. On a
real structure with several truncated LYS sidechains (`test/8cz8/
8cz8_t_u.pdb`, chain E — real crystallographic disorder, confirmed via
atom-count scan: 11 of 19 LYS residues in that chain carry only
`N/CA/C/O/CB`), this produced a genuinely different rebuilt
conformation from run to run of the exact same input, sometimes
surviving as D-Cα through the rest of the pipeline.

A second, more severe bug surfaced while verifying the fix: in
`prepare.pipeline.run_pdbfixer`, `PDBFixer.removeHeterogens()` and
`PDBFixer.replaceNonstandardResidues()` each rebuild an entirely new
Topology internally (`Modeller(...).delete(...)`), which silently
invalidates the *already-computed* `fixer.missingAtoms` dict (keyed by
Residue object identity against the topology that existed at
`findMissingAtoms()` time). The old call order — `findMissingAtoms()`
before `removeHeterogens()`/`replaceNonstandardResidues()` — meant
`addMissingAtoms()` silently added ZERO heavy atoms for every
genuinely-missing sidechain whenever heterogens were stripped (the
default), even though PDBFixer's own verbose log correctly reported
them as missing beforehand. Fixed by reordering to match PDBFixer's own
canonical usage (find/replace-nonstandard -> removeHeterogens ->
findMissingAtoms -> addMissingAtoms).
