# Tracked test fixtures

These are the input structures and companion sequences read by the pytest
suite. They were copied from the historical, mostly untracked `test/` working
tree so CI and fresh clones exercise the same structural regressions. Generated
outputs (`*_zbs`, prepared/minimized files, GRO files, and topology trees) are
deliberately excluded.

Run `sha256sum -c tests/fixtures/MANIFEST.sha256` from the repository root to
verify that none of the source fixtures changed accidentally.

## 8UCD molecule retention and connectivity

`rename_mols/structure.pdb` is the user-provided 8UCD preparation input copied
unchanged from `test/rename_mols/structure.pdb`. Split regression tests verify
that all 807 heterogen atoms (nine LBN/FAD/HEM residues) survive retention and
unique-chain assignment with unchanged coordinates and serials.

## 1VCU ligand chemistry

The optional-SMILES regression uses RCSB Chemical Component Dictionary
connectivity and DAN stereochemistry. The selected forms represent the
dominant DAN carboxylate and a representative HEPES/EPE zwitterion near
physiological pH, so the expected acidic oxygens remain unprotonated:

- DAN: `CC(=O)N[C@@H]1[C@H](C=C(O[C@H]1[C@@H]([C@@H](CO)O)O)C(=O)[O-])O`
- EPE: `C1CN(CC[NH+]1CCO)CCS(=O)(=O)[O-]`

Sources: [RCSB DAN](https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/DAN),
[RCSB EPE](https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/EPE), and
[PubChem HEPES (CID 23831)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Hepes).
At pH 7.4, HEPES is close to its approximately 7.55 buffer pKa, so protonated
zwitterionic and deprotonated anionic microspecies coexist; the test chooses
the slightly more populated zwitterion. A protein binding site can shift this
balance, so users should supply the microspecies appropriate to their system.
