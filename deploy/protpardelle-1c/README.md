# Protpardelle-1c research adapter

This directory contains the pinned DVBFixer research adapter and experimental
protocol runner for Protpardelle-1c revision
`ee378400f25b801fa481028000f9060183d7fb4c`. MODELLER remains the default and
production-supported backend.

## Apple Silicon preparation

Use a native arm64 Python environment and apply the Apple patch to the clean,
pinned upstream checkout:

```bash
micromamba create -f deploy/protpardelle-1c/environment-apple-arm64.yml
micromamba activate dvbfixer-protpardelle-apple
git clone https://github.com/ProteinDesignLab/protpardelle-1c.git "$PROTPARDELLE_ROOT"
git -C "$PROTPARDELLE_ROOT" checkout ee378400f25b801fa481028000f9060183d7fb4c
git -C "$PROTPARDELLE_ROOT" apply \
  "$DVBFIXER_ROOT/deploy/protpardelle-1c/apple-portability.patch"
python -m pip install --no-deps -e "$PROTPARDELLE_ROOT"
python -m pip install -e "$DVBFIXER_ROOT"
```

The checkpoint is operator-provided and is not downloaded or redistributed by
DVBFixer. Preserve an explicit environment export and `pip freeze` for every
accepted run in addition to the installable profile above.

Remove existing `__pycache__` directories from the Protpardelle checkout before
preflight. The production wrapper disables bytecode writes before loading the
engine so accepted runs do not recreate them.

The patch makes CUDA cache cleanup conditional and disables per-step host copies
of trajectory tensors when the adapter requests only final coordinates. It does
not change the denoising update or final coordinates. The existing callback patch
is not part of the frozen Apple baseline and must not be combined with this patch.

Before any MPS process starts, disable unsupported-operator fallback explicitly:

```bash
export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1
export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=0
```

Freeze the remaining MPS variables rather than changing them between lanes. The
initial baseline leaves fast math and Metal preference disabled/unset and retains
PyTorch's default allocator watermarks:

```bash
unset PYTORCH_MPS_FAST_MATH
unset PYTORCH_MPS_PREFER_METAL
unset PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO
unset PYTORCH_MPS_LOW_WATERMARK_RATIO
```

Collect the host record from the Protpardelle environment before inference. The
repository must be a clean checkout and the environment export must already
exist:

```bash
python scripts/collect_apple_diffusion_inventory.py \
  .artifacts/apple-diffusion/host-inventory.json \
  --environment-lock .artifacts/apple-diffusion/protpardelle-explicit.txt
```

Before using a materialized DVBFixer request, run paired synthetic operator
smokes with the pinned config and checkpoint:

```bash
python deploy/protpardelle-1c/operator_smoke.py \
  --config "$CONFIG" --checkpoint "$CHECKPOINT" \
  --output .artifacts/apple-diffusion/cpu-operator-smoke.json --device cpu
python deploy/protpardelle-1c/operator_smoke.py \
  --config "$CONFIG" --checkpoint "$CHECKPOINT" \
  --output .artifacts/apple-diffusion/mps-operator-smoke.json --device mps
python deploy/protpardelle-1c/compare_operator_smokes.py \
  .artifacts/apple-diffusion/cpu-operator-smoke.json \
  .artifacts/apple-diffusion/mps-operator-smoke.json \
  .artifacts/apple-diffusion/cpu-mps-operator-comparison.json
```

Run the one-step MPS operator smoke with signpost profiling enabled:

```bash
python deploy/protpardelle-1c/checkpoint_gap_smoke.py \
  WORKSPACE/request.json WORKSPACE/apple-mps-one-step \
  --config "$CONFIG" --checkpoint "$CHECKPOINT" \
  --device mps --steps 1 --mps-profile
```

The adapter fails instead of relabeling CPU execution as MPS. It verifies all
model parameters and buffers, sampler inputs, and final coordinates are on the
requested device. Timings synchronize MPS before measurement boundaries. MPS
tensor allocation, Metal driver allocation, recommended working-set size, and
process peak RSS are recorded separately because they overlap in unified memory
and must not be added together.

OpenMM refinement runs in the separate DVBFixer environment with the `CPU`
platform. It is not MPS acceleration.

## Experimental CLI protocol runner

The Apple environment can expose the frozen profile to the core CLI through:

```bash
export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1
export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=0

dvbfixer model INPUT.pdb --fasta TARGET.fasta \
  --backend diffusion \
  --diffusion-profile protpardelle-1c-mps \
  --diffusion-runner "$DVBFIXER_ROOT/deploy/protpardelle-1c/production_runner.py" \
  --diffusion-checkpoint "$MODEL_PARAMS/weights/cc89_epoch415.pth" \
  -o OUTPUT_BUNDLE
```

Run the command from the native Protpardelle environment so the runner shebang
resolves that environment's Python. `MODEL_PARAMS` must also contain
`configs/cc89.yaml`. The wrapper derives `PROTPARDELLE_MODEL_PARAMS` from this
checkpoint layout before importing Protpardelle, so the clean engine checkout
does not need an untracked `model_params` symlink. It uses the frozen 500-step
float32 MPS settings, disables per-step reinjection, performs generated-only
OpenMM refinement on the CPU, and writes the versioned `result.json` expected by
core DVBFixer. Provenance continues to identify MPS as the sampling device and
records CPU refinement separately. Core DVBFixer remains responsible for
independent validation and atomic publication.
