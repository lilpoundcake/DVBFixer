# DVBfixer GUI

Local graphical workspace for DVBfixer, protein structures, multiple alignment,
and homology modeling. It runs in the browser with a Node-side development
backend and an optional PostgreSQL-backed mutations table.

## What it does

- **3D viewer (×2)** -- interactive [Mol*](https://molstar.org) molecular
  visualization with custom residue-type coloring. Open a second viewer to
  compare structures side-by-side; toggle camera sync via the link icon in
  the top bar.
- **Sequence viewer** -- amino acid sequence with color-coded residue types,
  click or drag to select ranges
- **Pairwise alignment** -- Needleman-Wunsch with BLOSUM62 between any two
  chains, including across two different loaded structures
- **Bidirectional selection** -- click a residue in sequence or alignment, it
  highlights in 3D (solid ball-and-stick) and vice versa
- **Elements tree** -- hierarchical view of polymers, ligands, ions, and water
  with visibility toggles + per-chain **Show Interface** button (5 Å contact
  zone, distinguishes polymer vs ligand on the same chain id)
- **Interactions table** -- computed H-bonds, ionic, disulfide, hydrophobic,
  pi-stacking, and more with chain pair filtering; auto-filters when Show
  Interface is active
- **DVBfixer panel** -- every current CLI tool, generated from argparse and
  grouped by workflow and argument section
- **Homology workspace** -- persistent target/template projects, MAFFT,
  MUSCLE 5, or Clustal Omega MSA, manual gap editing, Modeller SALIGN, template
  span masks, and model generation
- **Mutations panel** -- editable DataGrid backed by PostgreSQL for keeping
  antibody mutation sets (e.g. YTE, LS, DLE)
- **Structure library** -- expandable tree of pre-loaded structures, star a
  child to make it the default-load target of its family root
- **Dockable panels** -- drag panels to rearrange, "+" button to spawn any
  panel into any tabset
- **Local files** -- upload your own .pdb or .mmcif files into either viewer

Everything except DVBFixer runs and the Mutations DB runs in the browser.
Your files never leave your machine.

## Install & run

### Minimum (viewer only — no DVBFixer, no Mutations DB)

```
git clone <repo-url>
cd DVBFixer/gui
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev:no-db
```

Open http://localhost:5173. The Mutations tab will show a configuration
hint; everything else works.

### Full install (DVBFixer + Mutations)

DVBfixer GUI drives the package in this repository and can store antibody
mutation sets in PostgreSQL.

**1.** Create the repository's DVBfixer environment and install the package:

```
micromamba create -f environment.yml
micromamba activate dvbfixer
pip install -e .
```

#### Modeller license

`model` and (indirectly) other DVBFixer commands rely on
[Modeller](https://salilab.org/modeller/), which requires a free academic
license. Register at <https://salilab.org/modeller/registration.html>, then:

```
micromamba activate dvbfixer
KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY bash gui/scripts/set-modeller-key.sh
```

The helper finds `<env>/lib/modeller-*/modlib/modeller/config.py` and writes
`license = r'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY'` into it (backing up the previous file).
You can also pass an explicit prefix as the first arg:

```
KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY bash scripts/set-modeller-key.sh /opt/conda/envs/tarantino
```

**2.** Start the app. PostgreSQL is auto-managed — if Docker is installed,
`npm run dev` spins up a local postgres container (port 5432) and sets
`DATABASE_URL` automatically. The `mutations` table is created on first
connection.

```
cd gui
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
micromamba activate dvbfixer   # so `dvbfixer` is on PATH
npm run dev
```

The first run downloads the postgres image; the container survives `Ctrl+C`
so subsequent runs are instant.

### DB controls

| Command             | What it does                                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`       | Auto-starts postgres (if docker present), then vite   |
| `npm run dev:no-db` | Skip auto-postgres, just run vite                     |
| `npm run db:up`     | Start the postgres container                          |
| `npm run db:down`   | Stop & remove the container (volume persists)         |
| `npm run db:logs`   | Tail postgres logs                                    |

**Override** the auto-setup by exporting `DATABASE_URL` yourself before
`npm run dev` — the script detects an existing value and skips Docker:

```
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://my-user:pw@my-host:5432/my-db
npm run dev
```

**Override DVBFixer** if it's not on PATH (e.g. wrapped in micromamba):

```
export DVBFIXER_CMD="micromamba run -n tarantino dvbfixer"
```

The DVBFixer tab is usable even without the env (it will just error on
Run); the Mutations tab is usable even without DATABASE_URL or Docker
(it will show a configuration message).

## Tech stack

React 19, TypeScript 6, Vite 6, Mol*, MUI (Material UI v9, plus
`@mui/x-data-grid`), flexlayout-react, Zustand. PostgreSQL via `pg`
(loaded lazily; optional). Vite middleware backend (`server/api-plugin.ts`).

## Panels

| Panel               | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3D Structure        | Mol* viewer with custom SCSS skin and residue-type color theme on sticks    |
| 3D Structure (B)    | Independent secondary viewer for side-by-side comparison; camera sync toggle in top bar |
| Sequence            | Monospace amino acid grid, drag-select, independent chain selector per tab  |
| Alignment           | Pairwise Needleman-Wunsch (BLOSUM62) across chains, incl. across structure A and B; click number row to pick the same column on both sides |
| Elements            | Categorized tree (polymer/ligand/ion/water) with per-component visibility + per-chain Show Interface |
| Interactions        | Computed non-covalent + covalent contacts, filterable by type and chain pair |
| DVBfixer            | Run all CLI commands with workflow- and argument-grouped forms generated from argparse |
| Homology            | Target → templates → editable MSA and masks → Modeller project workflow |
| Mutations           | Editable DataGrid backed by PostgreSQL (`mutations` table: chain / mutation_name / mutations) |
| Library             | Expandable tree of structures from `structures/`. **Everything is collapsed by default** — click a chevron to open a parent. Star a row to set it as the family's default load target. Auto-refreshes whenever anything in the library changes. |
| Info                | Editable metadata (name, organism, method, resolution, notes) + stats. Edits **auto-save per-structure** to `index.json` (debounced 500 ms). |

Every panel can be duplicated via the "+" button on its tabset header.
Sequence panels maintain independent chain selections.

## DVBfixer commands

| Command   | What it does                                                                              |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| split     | Empirical chain splitting via residue numbering / peptide-bond distance / nearest-atom gaps |
| renumber  | Renumber residues by aligning ATOM records to SEQRES; removes Kabat-style insertion codes |
| model     | Rebuild missing loops / gaps with Modeller (LoopModel + MD refinement)                     |
| prepare   | Add missing residues, heavy atoms, hydrogens via PDBFixer; supports point mutations        |
| minimize  | Energy-minimize with OpenMM (AMBER14 + GLYCAM); optional xtb / obminimize post-refine     |
| protonate | Predict per-residue pKa (PROPKA3); rename to AMBER protonation variants at target pH       |
| convert   | Convert structure naming between PDB/AMBER/GLYCAM and CHARMM conventions. Default (`--to-amber`): PDB/CHARMM → GLYCAM sugars + AMBER protonation variants (HID/HIE/HIP, ASH/GLH, LYN, CYX/CYM). With `--to-charmm`: reverse direction (GLYCAM/AMBER → CHARMM, NLN/OLS/OLT revert to ASN/SER/THR, ROH/OME caps dropped). The two flags are mutually exclusive. `--no-roh` applies only to the `--to-amber` direction. Was named `glycam` in older DVBFixer versions. |

The complete command and flag schema is generated by
`../scripts/gen_gui_spec.py` from each command's argparse parser. This keeps the
GUI synchronized with new DVBfixer releases, including repeatable and
multi-value options.

## Library hierarchy & starring

The Library panel renders structures as a tree. Entries get a `parent` field
in `index.json` either manually or automatically (every successful DVBFixer
run is registered as a child of its input file). Children are auto-expanded
when something new appears.

Each row has a star button. Starring a descendant marks it as the
**default-load target** of its family root: clicking the root then loads the
starred descendant instead. The root row shows an orange `⭐ → <name>`
hint chip when this is in effect. The tree structure is unchanged — starring
just flips a flag.

When two 3D viewers are open, a small `A` / `B` toggle in the Library header
chooses which viewer the next click loads into.

## Adding structures to the library

Drop `.pdb`, `.cif`, or `.mmcif` files into `structures/` (subfolders are
scanned recursively; directories starting with `.` or `_` are skipped).
They are auto-detected — no config needed. Stale `index.json` entries whose
files have been deleted are auto-pruned on every scan.

For richer metadata, add an entry to `structures/index.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "1abc",
  "file": "1abc.pdb",
  "name": "My Protein",
  "organism": "Homo sapiens",
  "chains": 2,
  "residues": 150,
  "description": "Short description of what this structure is"
}
```

To mark something as a child of another structure, add `"parent": "<file>"`.

## Pre-loaded structures

The repo ships with an Fc-receptor / C1q working set focused on antibody
engineering use cases:

| File              | Name   | Notes                                                                 |
|-------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FcRn.pdb`        | FcRn   | Neonatal Fc receptor (recycling / half-life extension; YTE target)    |
| `FcgRI.pdb`       | FcγRI  | High-affinity IgG receptor (CD64)                                     |
| `FcgRIIa.pdb`     | FcγRIIa | Low-affinity IgG receptor (CD32a)                                    |
| `FcgRIIb.pdb`     | FcγRIIb | Inhibitory IgG receptor (CD32b)                                      |
| `FcgRIIIa.pdb`    | FcγRIIIa | Low-affinity IgG receptor (CD16a; F158 wild-type)                   |
| `FcgRIIIa_158V.pdb` | FcγRIIIa V158 | V158 high-responder allotype variant of FcγRIIIa              |
| `FcgRIIIb.pdb`    | FcγRIIIb | GPI-anchored neutrophil IgG receptor (CD16b)                        |
| `C1q.pdb`         | C1q    | Complement classical-pathway recognition subunit                      |

These were chosen as everyday antibody-engineering substrates (Fc / FcγR /
FcRn / C1q interactions). Swap them out for your own files; the scanner
auto-detects anything you drop into `structures/`.

## Build for production

```
npm run build
```

Output goes to `dist/`. Serve it with any static file server:

```
npx serve dist
```

Note: the production build is **viewer-only**. The DVBFixer and Mutations
backends are dev-time Vite middleware in `server/api-plugin.ts` — they
don't ship in the static build. To run those in production, host a Node
server that re-uses the plugin (or port the routes).

## Notes

- Water is hidden by default when a structure loads
- The custom color theme (carbons by residue type, non-carbons CPK) applies to focus/stick representations
- Non-canonical amino acids (phosphorylated residues, modified cysteines, protonation variants, etc.) are normalized to standard codes
- Failed DVBFixer runs are moved to `structures/_dvb_failed/` so they don't pollute the library; the scanner skips `_*` and `.*` directories
- The `postinstall` script (`scripts/fix-native-deps.mjs`) handles cross-platform rollup native bindings for macOS and Linux
